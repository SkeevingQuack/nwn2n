Travel; we obliterate a small orc encampment

###### 17

We find Old Owl Well, meet Oswin Kane, hear about Yaisog's location, meet Simee, Peregrin brings a letter

###### 18

A part of the road is collapsed, we lure a troll into a larger orc army encampment. Then exploded a cave.

###### 19

*Note: [source](sessions/2017-06-19.md) was not very specific and this date might be wrong.*

We fight our way into [Yaisog]'s main army encampment, and they seem to recognize us as [Katulmak] and plan to have some sort of more formal battle. The [Augur] of Gruumsh comes forward and treats with us, Vess makes a flippant comment about how little effort it took, and the Augur realizes that we aren't the Katulmak at all. The Katulmak is some human who has been fighting them for years (or maybe him and his group is the Katulmak).

We decide to give up our weapons and travel with the Augur to Yaisog at his stronghold. We travel along a river in two boats, and eventually stop in a cave to spend the night. [Balthazar] drinks some of the Augur's tea, has a vision, and has one of his eyes cursed.

###### 20

We wake up, get back in the boats, and arrive at the [Yaisog] stronghold. We are locked up in a cell along with someone named [Penton] who used to be a head miner for the [Silverthorns].

The [Augur] tells us cryptic things that sort of imply that he'll help us kill [Logram] because Logram is a heretic.

We attempt to escape, but fail. In the process, [Galleon] psychological tortures Penton. We end up locked into separate cells in an arena.

###### 21

The [Augur] eventually comes to talk to each of us about our religion, then paints our bodies with stuff and gives us back some basic equipment. We eventually fight and kill [Yaisog]'s son in a stadium filled with most of the population of the stronghold. We get our stuff back, get a detailed map that leads us to the [Eyegouger] stronghold, and the Augur implied that [Logram] has [Asani].

###### 22

We find Sir [Casavir], [Katriana], and his group, which is apparently the [Katulmak]. They fight the orcs, but it seems that his relationship with [Neverwinter] is a lot murkier.

The party continues on alone, meeting very little resistance considering how close we are.

###### 24

*Note: Should be accurate by fiat*

We find the stronghold, which it turns out is an old dwarven stronghold. We kill some goblins out front, but quickly realize they were just slaves. We are then ambushed by some sort of abused, metal spider. Inside we find minimal forces, but one person is a necromancer who has a journal talking about their plans for this stronghold. Haunting this stronghold is [Morda Firebeard], the last queen of the clan that once ruled this stronghold. She tells us that she isn't entirely in control of herself.

We find a room with some sort of alter and around 100 severely injured people. Vess tries to destroy destroy the alter, but the only effect is that several hostages are killed. We start moving people to the entrance, providing them with medical care and food, but we're interrupted partway through. We destroy some dwarven golems, then return to find that the altar room is now a portal to some other plane. 

*Note: [Source](sessions/2017-07-31) says the Conductor "invites us to the Shadowfell", but I forget exactly how that happend. I'm also not sure of the order of most of these two days after this point*

We head into the new portal to meet the [Conductor], hoping to get some information. We see a church filled with creepy people with no individual will, one of them being [Balthazar]'s father [Isaac]. The Conductor tries to convince us that servitude to the [King of Shadows] is preferable to free will. We learn that Logram isn't a normal, living being. The party chops the Conductor up as [Vess] sits on the floor and watches. The plane starts to collapse, and we make our way back to the stronghold. The room is back, but the remaining captives are hanging from the ceiling by their intestines.

We find various treasures and chests, as well as a warning that thieves will be cursed. Between the curse and the moral implications, everyone decides not to take any real treasure.

###### 25

[Galleon] takes stuff from the chest below the curse warning, but no one else knows.

We make our way into the mine to kill [Logram]. We kill a necromancer, and when we throw him into some lava he turns into black goo. We found Asani in horrible condition, but did what we could to keep him alive.

We fought Logram and what was probably his harem. Logram seemed like a normal, living orc, and when we killed him all his companions were boiled from the inside and died.

We rest and wait for the noxious smoke to clear, then bring [Asani] with us to the surface. 

###### 26

[The Conductor] sent [Vess] a [dream].

There are orcs among the people we saved, and it's causing tension so we send them on their way. We head out with the others back to [Old Owl Well]. 

###### 28

We encounter a fleeing orc company and capture a goblin.

###### 30

At noon we arrive at an intact [Old Owl Well]. Sir [Kallum] and [Asani] seem to know eachother well. Sir Kallum thanked us for our help, and explained that the orcs suddenly broke and fled a day after the siege started. Asani says he'll go to see [I forgot] that he will be in [Neverwinter] by sunset. He won't say how.

[Vess] and [Balthazar] went to see Sir [Oswin Kane]. She asked if the argument with [Aliss] had something to do with a missing person, as it was possible they'd come across them in their travels. He doesn't believe that was the case, and further conversation reveals that Sir Oswin is at Old Owl Well because King [Nasher] has a specific reason. He thanks the party for what we've done.

They then go see Aliss, but still don't get anything solid about her problem or objectives.

### Midwinter, 1403

We relax and wait for the arrival of [Simee]. She mentions that she has contacts at the jewelry shop in [Neverwinter] known as [Mortimers]. She suggests that if we want to get to Neverwinter quickly, the court mage in [Roenel] might have the ability to teleport us.

Peregrin arrives with [a letter] from Hector. Vess transcribes parts of it relevant to the rest of the party, and sends [a response].

[Galleon] *Sends* to Kelgar, telling him about the [Firebeard] stronghold. It seems to get through, but there's no response. We let [Sir Kallum] know about it as well.

### Alturiak (The Claw of Winter), 1403

###### 1

The party sets out for [Roenel].

[Roenel]: institutions/Roe.md

###### 3

The party starts to reconsider calling themselves "The Conductors", since apparently [the Conductor] is still a thing and confusion about whose side we're on might be bad.

[Balthazar] shares that he's been dreaming about Gruumsh chaining him, other gods freeing him and re-chaining him, etc. [Vess] shares her [dream] from the Conductor. [Dimirroden] shares that he had a dream that he only recently realized might not be entirely fictional.

It was from the perspective of [Dalrin], and he was being tortured by the githyanki leader [Zier Zawar Mec]. He overhead them say that they should forget the betrayer and the escapee, they just need to recover what was lost and kill the [Kalek-cha].

The [cultist stones] have been glowing, it turns out. [Galleon] walks into shadow to accept the call, and we hear him and the Conductor speaking, with the Conductor being very frank. [Logram] betrayed both the [Augur] and the Conductor. The cultist agents in the area haven't been performing and have been "recalled". Galleon suggests that a better way of convincing us to join is to offer that we'd share in the power. The Conductor gloats that Logram wasn't undead at all and he just played us. He ends with "Kelgar sends his regards."

We realize that Duncan and Chandra have been not responding to *Sending*s, just like Kelgar. Balthazar tries to contact his father with *Sending* and the cultist stones activate again. Balthazar tries to contact his father with a stone, and it works. [Isaac] seems overwhelmed, but he's happy he's able to help the [King of Shadows] against the [Raven Queen] in the Shadowfell. Isaac suggests that he could take the Gruumsh curse unto himself.

###### 4

We stopped at a [Roenel] checkpoint, and they asked us for our business. We said we were going to speak to the court mage, and they got suspicious. [Dimirroden] tried to bribe them, thinking that was maybe just how you do things. They sent us on our way, but also sent a messenger bird to the city. 

[Vess] tried to shapechange and catch the bird, but failed. When the party made it to Roenel, Vess went in alone to try and negotiate with the mage without raising suspicion. Things were locked up tight and she didn't manage it, and went back outside the walls to report to the party.

A raven then caught Vess's attention, and she went over to talk with it. It spoke to her as [Chanel], the court mage, and did so in Druidic. Vess and the raven negotiated for transport, and then it turned into a very dark-skinned elf woman. Chanel explains that she received word from "friends in the West that war would be on the horizon", war with the undead. She says we're on the side of [Hector] and we are "highly recommended".

Chanel explains the city is preparing to fight necromancers. She teleports us for 3000gp and the Staff of the Python, and we give her a free [cultist stone] in case she can figure something out that helps the war effort. She teleports us to right outside [Neverwinter].

*Note: [More stuff](sessions/2017-08-21.md), I just don't have time.*

###### 5

Sand says that the food at the dead drop for Chandra and Duncan is always taken. They should be at the old hideout in the merchant district, a warehouse named Sand's Sanding Sandporium. The party heads over to check it out and finds githyanki inside.

*Note: [More stuff](sessions/2017-08-28.md), but I want to get everything else down first before I forget.*

###### 6

We wake up to find that Dimirrodin has run off to be protected by the church of Lethander. He happened across a paladin on his way, and sent this paladin, Kail, to help us. 

*Note: [More stuff](sessions/2017-09-11.md), but I should sleep soon.*

*Note: [Even more stuff that day, holy shit](sessions/2017-09-18.md).*
