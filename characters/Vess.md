#### Overview

Born 1373DR in Silverymoon, Vesna Tchurminska was the fourth of five children in the Tchurminov family, a relatively new but influential noble family of Silverymoon. She was quiet as a child and prone to laziness. Her parents failed to motivate her with any tactic they’d used with the other children; she was content with doing nothing, seemed to have nothing she wanted, and won most arguments where her parents tried to convince her that it was her duty to do something. Anything they managed to convince her to do, however, she did steadily and effectively.

When Voislav got a dog, Vess bonded so quickly and completely with it that he had trouble actually calling it his. Vess’s parents started to bribe her with pets, but she quickly learned to negotiate the terms well enough that doing this too often become costly. 

Nearly all of her free time was spent napping with her pets, lying in one place and thinking, or taking care of her pets. When she became old enough to roam the city (accompanied by a guard), her pastimes grew to include napping in trees, drinking tea at a tea house (and then napping there), and napping on grassy hillocks. 

When she hit puberty and showed no signs of changing her behavior, her parents gave up. Maybe a rich merchant would find her charming and be willing to marry her for her name and family connections. Ater all, the worst thing that could happen was that their daughter remained single, happy, and always around for conversation. She wasn’t much of a monetary burden, either, as long as they kept the pets to a minimum. They concentrated on her education and etiquette, and eventually they stopped worrying about it.

#### A New Home

In 1387DR, the Tchurminovs wintered in Neverwinter. As they left late in the Spring, a merchant they had been dealing with convinced them that cutting through the Neverwinter Wood was both faster and more pleasant.Only a few miles into the Wood, they were attacked by highwaymen. The air filled with screams, blood, and frantic instructions, and Vess fled into the forest to hide. By the time she calmed down, she realized that she had been running for hours. She didn’t know where she had come from and started to wander the forest hoping to find any sign of her caravan. She didn’t, but eventually she happened across a stream. Unsure of what else to do, she drank as much as she could and curled up for the night. 

When she awoke, she was too terrified of doing anything wrong to do anything. She knew she shouldn’t move away from a source of water, and that it was probably best to just conserve energy and wait to be found. Even when she found berries within a couple dozen feet of the stream, she worried they would be poisonous. She tried to sleep as much as possible, but often woke up in a sweat, dry-heaving from anxiety. 

By the time a passing hunter found her, she was too delirious to know how long it had been. Ana took Vess to her home (a structure best described as an incredibly comfortable hunting blind) and nursed her back to health, but it took a day and many pounds of food before Vess started talking. Vess told Ana what happened, and she immediately promised to do what she could to find Vess’s family. Vess didn’t respond, but simply closed her eyes and lay next to Ana’s dog Mok, who already seemed to regard Vess with more affection than he did Ana.

Ana found the site of the incident within a couple weeks, miles away from where she had found Vess. The wagons had been broken and nothing was left of the bodies but bloodstained scraps of cloth and the occasional gnawed bone shard. Ana never found the right time to tell Vess, and Vess never brought up the subject. The girl just quietly learned to help Ana find food and prepare furs, doing her best to keep Ana from feeling any hardship for saving her.

Years passed, and Ana was amazed at how well Vess adapted to her lifestyle. The amount of time Vess spent sleeping had started to annoy Ana, but then she realized that Vess always did more than her fair share of work in between her naps. When she started training Vess to hunt, Ana realized she became impatient long before Vess did. On one hunt as they were waiting in an area frequented by deer, she was sure that Vess had fallen asleep. Ana turned to gently wake her, but found that Vess was already loosing an arrow straight into the deer’s heart.

It took a couple more years before Ana admitted to herself that whatever was going on with Vess was beyond her ken. Roots and branches seemed to shift slightly out of her way, she seemed to always know what the weather would be without opening her eyes (let alone going outside), and at one point a flock of starlings had rested on her as she napped in a tree. Ana told Vess that they needed to travel to pay a tribute to guardians of the Wood. Vess accepted this without question, and they headed, weaponless, to a sacred grove Ana had stumbled upon decades ago. 

#### Druidic Tutelage

It took several days to arrive at the grove, and they spent another day quietly waiting. An elf dressed in furs and leaves appeared on the second day, and Ana pulled him aside to tell him what she’d seen. Before she could even start, he confirmed that Vess had a level of aptitude rarely seen, and that he would gladly take her under his wing. 

Vess immediately refused. Ana told Vess that she loved her and would love to stay with her, but staying with this druid for a year is the one thing she will ever ask Vess to do. Seeing the indecision on Vess’s face, Ana bowed to the druid, then turned and walked out of the grove.

Vess, in what may well have been her first ever fit of pique, tried her hardest to laze about even more than she normally did. Much to her chagrin, the druid seemed impressed with this. His favorite part seemed to be when various forest animals would join her as she slept, seemingly finding her more comfortable than any place that didn’t have a human in it. Vess grudgingly admitted to herself that this was probably pretty weird, and that maybe actually exploring this side of herself would be worth the trouble.

Korlin began to teach her to listen to animals, to understand what they want, need, and feel. They quickly moved onto plants, and then the primal force of nature itself. The most important role of a druid, he said, is to listen to nature and to make sure that what you hear is untainted by bias. The voice of nature is subtle, and you can never be sure if some other druid is letting their emotions influence what they hear.

It took most of the year for Vess to learn to control nature. She had to convince an all-encompassing, ethereal force to throw aside all caution and follow her will, but she wasn’t even able to convince herself that it would be worth it. Using nature this way had repercussions, and was it really worth the death of a tree to prepare her for a future she’d never wanted? Korlin had to search for trouble, scaring away loggers or endangered animal poachers. Only in the moment could Vess will nature to follow her, and even then it failed if she thought Korlin could handle it alone. 

When they moved on to wild shaping, she picked it up almost immediately. Most of what she spent was her own energy, and she had always felt a connection with animals. It seemed to make her even less inclined towards activity, however, and Korlin was not nearly as impressed with her laziness now as he had been at the beginning.

At the end of the year, Vess immediately left to see Ana. She had expected them to take weeks catching up with eachother, but Ana’s life had never been very eventful and Vess had very little that she was capable of explaining. It took mere days before they both realized that the only thing left to talk about was Vess’s future.

Everything Ana knew about druids came from stories she’d heard as a child or the reactions of villagers when she emerged from the woods after growing a bit lax in her personal grooming. But that was enough to guess that druids were the only thing that kept humans from clearcutting woods for crops, lumber, and pasture. The tumultuous times kept it from being too much of a threat currently, but Ana was certain that a stable era of growth could spell the end of the Wood. 

Ana never explicitly encouraged Vess one way or the other, and Vess never announced a decision. They fell back into their old lifestyle, basking in the comfort of their company. Some weeks later, Vess assured Ana that she’d come back often to visit and headed out to find Korlin. 

As soon as she returned, Korlin began to teach her about the other side of druidism. Vess learned Druidic and was taught the different aspects of the society druids had made for themselves. Despite their insular lifestyle, the social hierarchy seemed just as complicated and important as any she’d encountered among nobles, though at least the etiquette was more sensible and lax. She would attend gatherings of druids for rituals and was quickly invited to participate in them.

The more she progressed, the more she was allowed to spend time alone and watch over her own part of the forest. The longer she was alone, the more she was bothered by Korlin and the other druids. Decisions were to be based on the will of the Wood, but it quickly became obvious that different druids interpreted that will different. And since these interpretations relied on intuition rather than reason, arguments were generally resolved by politicking and discrediting your fellows. 

As the years passed, Vess gained respect only for her abilities. She often disagreed with those in power, and she refused to back down on any points that would allow her to form more permanent alliances. The biggest issue was the way druids handled encroaching civilization: settlements were allowed small amounts of resources, but overstepping any boundary was met with violent resistance. To Vess, this would only encourage powerful cities to destroy forests en masse to root out druids. She thought that maybe druids could work with civilization to limit what resources they need, and hopefully find a sustainable way to live.

She grew apart from Korlin and the other druids, the number of gatherings she attended dwindled until it only included the important rituals where she was truly needed. The largest gathering was a yearly ritual attended by both her own Circle of the Wood and their sibling Circle of the Mere. The Circle of Swords had split into these two factions right around the time of her birth, when the Archdruid had died and no replacement was named. Vess learned that the Circle of the Mere was more open to change than her own circle, and for a while she hoped that she may be able to find druids of a like mind there. The little she heard from them, however, convinced her that it would likely be a waste of energy.

Vess wasn’t allowed to share most of what she learned with Ana, but she would talk about the broad strokes of her frustrations when she visited. Ana never took sides, but over time Vess got the impression that Ana largely agreed with the more militant ideas of the druids. 

Vess started to question herself. Her spells failed her in a way they hadn’t since her first year. She considered giving up and living peacefully with Ana, but felt that it would be too much of a betrayal of her five years of training.

As Vess agonized over what to do, she began to think of her family. It was a subject she’d avoided for the past ten years, telling herself that it was a miracle that even she had survived. She knew that Ana had searched for her caravan in the initial weeks, and she had seen the look on Ana’s face when that search had suddenly stopped. Bringing up the subject would have been painful for both of them, and Vess would hate herself if she made Ana think she was ungrateful.

Now, she realized that her reasoning was just rationalization. Not only would she have had to face the reality of her family’s death, she would have to take control of all of her family’s enterprises. It was a role she’d never wanted, and after her family’s death it would have been even more difficult and unpleasant than she had ever imagined it could be. She eventually had started to feel ashamed for avoiding it, but that shame only made it harder to think about.

So nearly ten years after Ana had found Vess, Vess asked about her caravan. Ana began to cry and apologize, explaining that she had deluded herself into thinking that it was best for Vess not to mention it. Sure, she’d found abandoned wagons and dead bodies, but there was no way she could be certain that every member of Vess’s family was among them. It was her job as the adult to do everything she could to return Vess to where she belonged, but she’d been too selfish. She hadn’t wanted to see Vess go through any more pain, and she’d appreciated having the company. Ana had always wanted a child, but had never been interested in anything that led up to it.

They spent a while crying together, each trying to take the blame and assure the other that what they did, they did out of love. Neither one of them managed to fully convince the other, but they both knew that there was really only one thing they could do to make things right.

#### Homecoming

#### Unfinished parts

[Something happens here, starting when she’s 14, in which she lives in the Neverwinter Wood, is accepted to the Circle of Swords/Wood, does well but feels like she doesn’t really agree with the circle, leaves (when she’s 24), and probably reconnects with her family. She has some interest in the Circle of the Mere, but a combination of laziness, other priorities, and doubt that their beliefs will actually match hers has kept her from ever making contact.]

She has spent the last 3-5 years wandering Neverwinter Kingdom, trying to popularize policy or farming methods that will help keep civilization happy but contained and sustainable. Her family name can often get her access to city leaders, but she has had trouble actually getting anything done that way. She’s had more success teaching farmers better farming techniques, but without other changes that will just encourage urban sprawl.

She recently traveled to Highcliff hoping to teach local farmers about crop rotation.

## Family

#### Great grandparents: Vek Tchurminov / [greatgrandmother]

Born in Damara, Vek was the son of a skilled but unassuming cobbler. Instead of following his father, he joined a small merchant company and aimed to bring his father the fame he deserved. Before even a decade had passed, Vek’s father was the most renowned cobbler in Helgabal, the merchant company was significantly larger, and Vek had control of it.

Vek continued to grow his company and soon realized that Damara was perhaps the least pleasant place he had ever been. Taking a liking to Silverymoon, he moved his base of operations there and focused on making himself indispensible to the mercantile interests of the city rather than grow his business as a whole. He climbed his way up the social ranks as well, making allies, marrying the youngest daughter of some minor nobility, and, by the time he was 80, gaining his own noble title as part of a major trade deal. He named his house after his father Tchurminov, then passed away within a year.

#### Grandparents: Zdzisław \[zdjeeswaf\] Tchurminov / [grandmother]

Zdzisław immediately made it clear that he wasn’t going to rest on his father’s hard work. He solidified alliances, partnered with major artisans, and even married an unimportant daughter of some major nobility (as much as one can marry an elf). However, this time it was not just a marriage of convenience. $grandmother seemed to have as much pride in the family as Zdzisław did, and worked with him to make Tchurminov a name everyone in Silverymoon respected.

Naming Bilyana as his successor was probably the largest point of contention in their marriage. She was the eldest, but had always been $grandmother’s least favorite due to her attitude regarding the family. When Bilyana officially took over $grandmother washed her hands of the business, and after Zdzisław’s death she visits only on special occasions.

#### Parents: Clyde / Bilyana Tchurminska

Though Bilyana was proud of her family and understood that playing up the Damaran angle made good business sense, she thought things were getting a little out of hand. Vek had, after all, been the son of a cobbler and hated Damara; there was no good excuse for them to look down their noses at people or name their daughters “Bilyana”. It was especially odd coming from $grandmother, and Bilyana often introduced herself as “Billy Winterprison” when she wanted to annoy her.

Bilyana was much more relaxed about managing the Tchurminov empire. She delegated many responsibilities to family members and employees and was known to have friendships that weren’t based entirely around business and politics. She wasn’t lazy, however, and the decisions she made gained the respect of her siblings even if they didn’t quiet the grumbling of half-felt jealousy. 

She married Clyde, a Silverymoon guardsman of no renown whatsoever. No one is even sure how they met, though plenty of sordid rumors abound among the nobility. Despite this, he has integrated well into noble society; even the snootiest nobles admit that he rarely makes a fool of himself and he might even be considered witty.

#### Siblings: Voislav, Kazkalina, Miro, Vesna, Danica

The obvious heirs to the Tchurminov mercantile empire are the fraternal twins Voislav and Kazkalina. They seem to have the same fire that drove Vek, but with a playful cunning that their mother thoroughly approves of. They refuse to reveal publicly which of them is the eldest or whether Bilyana even cares about that when choosing a successor; if you gain their trust and swear yourself to secrecy, however, they might just let you know. Too bad the answer they give is different every time.

Miro’s interest in the family business starts and ends with how much he can learn from it. That often means travelling with Tchurminov caravans to new cities or spending a day with an artisan discussing the intricacies of their work, but by far the most convenient way is reading. Miro can spend whole days doing little besides reading, and even while doing other things he is never without a book somewhere on his person. He and Vess were often together as children, with Vess cuddled up against him as he read.

Judging from their children’s personalities were shaping up, Bilyana and Clyde were worried that their next child would make stones seem energetic. Danica proved those fears baseless by being perhaps the most energetic Tchurminov in three generations. Much to Bilyana’s relief, however, that energy isn’t focused solely into the family business; the Tchurminovs had avoided any major intra-family power struggles so far, and she didn’t want her kids to be the first to experience it.
