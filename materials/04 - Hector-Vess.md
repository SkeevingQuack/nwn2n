# Hector Royson to Vess, via arcane messenger falcon

*Dear Lady Vess,*

*I hope that Peregrin finds you in good health. This is Lord Hector Royson, we met briefly in Highcliffe concerning the lizardfolk. I said that I would keep you in the loop concerning matters in the south and I mean to keep that promise. Despite their grousing the southern lords have calmed down over the relocation of the lizardfolk, and they in turn have acclimated well to their new home. I think you would appreciate how far they've come in such a short amount of time. Every challenge that's been thrown their way they've surmounted, whether it be bandits or keeping the Llyn Dinas from freezing over (the magic that their shamans employ is fascinating!). I have been working closely with Slaan, as their chieftain has gone on some sort of spiritual quest in search of answers. To what they will not tell me more on, but for the meantime I trust in our new allies.*

*The southern great houses have become even more insular of late. Even my lord father has been in close contact with only a few of our allies. As of yet he has not confided what is brewing, but I beg of you to be careful in Neverwinter. I fear that the southern lords are not the only actors in this little play. I have looked more into the allegations of this necrotic cult but found very little. After your friends actions at Fort Locke and Castle Highcliffe it seems they have gone to ground. I will of course keep my eyes and ears open to more news.*

*A final matter. I realize that your path has led you to Neverwinter, and that you have matters of your own to pursue, but I would be delighted if you would visit me and my family at Castle Pherae. Consider this an open invitation to you, and if they are interested, your companions.*

*Yours in friendship,*

*Hector*
