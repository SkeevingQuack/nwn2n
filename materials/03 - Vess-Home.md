# Vess to Voislav & Kazkalina Tchurminov in Silverymoon via raven

Officially sealed and sent via ravens, written in Damaran

*My dearest twins,*

*My friend in the Silverthorne family says that they’ve fallen on hard times here in Neverwinter. They have mining rights to some very lucrative deposits, but as of right now most of their land is controlled by invading orcs and things throughout Neverwinter are tense enough that chances of them taking it back any time soon are slim. Because of this, he’s thinking of moving to Silverymoon. If there is anywhere his talents could be of use, I’m sure he would appreciate you pointing it out to him. If he tries to tell you I owe him for a favor, let him know that the ship I gave him should more than cover that.*

*I’m doing what I can to calm things down in Neverwinter, for what it’s worth. Normally I’d say it’s worth very little, but normally I wouldn’t accidentally obtain a boat full of trade goods. I hope Silverymoon isn’t nearly as chaotic as things are here, and I look forward to your letters just as soon as I stay in one town for more than a week.*

*Your useless sister,*

*Vess*
