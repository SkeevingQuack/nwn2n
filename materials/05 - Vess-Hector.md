# Vess to Hector Royson, via Peregrin

*Dear Lord Hector,*

*I'm immensely pleased to hear about the success of your treaty with the lizardfolk. I am fine, but you are not wrong about trouble in Neverwinter; I don't seem to know much more than you do, however. I'll be careful, but I have work to do and I apologize if my letter is somewhat abbreviated. I would love to visit your family, though I worry with how things are going that any business which brings me to the area will leave me with little free time. I hope I do not end up presuming upon the hospitality you've extended me.*

*With reverence,*

*Vesna*
