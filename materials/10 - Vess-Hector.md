# Vess to Hector, via Peregrin

*The letter did find me well, though our party is leaving the mountains with one fewer functioning eyeball and some more emotional baggage. We’ve also come out of this ordeal with the name “The Conductors”, and the practical repercussions of this are only now occurring to me. A distressingly large number of my decisions seem to be motivated by spite these days, so… don’t say you weren’t warned. Oh, and the prayers are most definitely warranted; your amulet has done so much good that I’ve started to take it for granted, so it’s comforting that at least one of us is properly paying Týr the respect he deserves.*

*The orcs did indeed make a grand push against OOW, but we killed their leader and broke their army. Depending on how much you trust my interpretation of an orcish Gruumsh priest’s ramblings, it will be many years before the orcs can consolidate again.*

*We have now met the Conductor, who appears to be some form of greater undead who serves the King of Shadows. There was a point at which he may have had us at his mercy, but he only used the opportunity to attempt to convince us that true happiness can only be found in unthinking servitude. As to the rest of your findings: I don’t know who this BG might be, and it occurs to me that all these cultists may have died and simply left behind nothing which would look like a corpse.*

*I’m sorry if this letter has been morbid and overdramatic. Adventuring is naught but stress and frustration, and sarcasm and black humour seems to be how I cope. You and Balthazar are just about the only good things to come from this whole endeavor. I’d happily abandon it entirely, but even the most selfish part of me thinks that would be a bad idea.*

*My connection to nature continues to increase apace with archdruids of legend, and it may be best to prepare ahead of time for some of the implications of that. The first question might be rather uncomfortable, but it’s all the more important for it: If you were to die, would you be willing to be brought back, even if it means you lose your original body and race? Secondly, are you willing to accept the consequences if a woman you’re courting turns into a bear right in front of a crowd of your people? Lastly, is there a massive tree near Castle Pharae, and if there isn’t are you willing to let me coax one into existence?*

*Hopefully I can see you soon. The length of this letter makes it obvious to me just how much talking with you helps me. Balthazar is eager to see his family again, but not even that is enough to justify the time we would spend traveling.*

*fondly,*
*Vess*

*P.S. Does the name "Grayson" mean anything to you?*
