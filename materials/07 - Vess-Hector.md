# Vess to Hector, via Peregrin

*My family would be overjoyed to hear your offer, but I have to wonder if you have any idea what you’d be getting yourself into. If you think I bring passion into what I do, it can be nothing more than frustration that this task I’ve given myself has been longer and more complicated than I’d hoped. I would happily leave Neverwinter to fend for itself if I didn’t believe doing so would pervert all the lands within hundreds of miles of my home. I think you and Balthazar were the only ones who believed the war could be avoided back in Highcliffe; I had assumed it was inevitable but I had no stake in either side. Up until this point, the only thing I’ve impressed anyone with is the depth of my laziness.*

*You are surprisingly unruffled by what I’m capable of as a druid, but I don’t think you realize the implications. If I manage to live through my current situation, it’s likely I will outlive not just your grandchildren but your entire House and the kingdom of Neverwinter. I’m not even sure I could stand to live among the citizens of Neverwinter for any length of time; I may be too used to spending my time among trees and beasts.*

*...if none of that managed to change your mind, then I would be delighted to spend some time living at Castle Pharae when all of this is done. You impressed me in Highcliffe, and you’ve only further improved my opinion of you since (except for that bout of what I know assume was lust-filled bravado in the cave with the necromancers.)  But until you’ve seen what I’m truly like — who I truly am — I will make you no promises and accept no promises you make me.*

&nbsp;

*And I’d suggest you look into Damaran naming conventions before you interact with the rest of my family, assuming you’re trying to make a good impression. None of us (except my grandmother) insist upon everyone getting it right, but I think my mother would be disappointed if my suitor didn’t even bother.*
