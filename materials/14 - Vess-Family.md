# Letter from Vess to Tchurminovs

Sent via 2 separate merchant caravans from Neverwinter to Silverymoon.

*My dear family,*

*I mean this with all possible warmth and love: if you try to involve me in the family's real business I will fall asleep on your couch and never move again. Waukeen seems to be throwing business opportunies at me, and it's simply easiest to divert them towards you all. I'm sure that were the twins with me, they would already own Neverwinter.*

*And I'm sorry, but I'm wrapped up in this as deep as I possibly could be. I've passed the point where I could get out of it, so I'll just have to do my best to ride it out till the end. I'll visit as soon as I get the chance.*

*I love you all,*

*Vess*
