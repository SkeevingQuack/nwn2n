# Letter to Vess from Miro Tchurminov

Arrived with [Clyde's letter]

*Vess,*

*It's good to hear from you again sister! I'm sure father will cover most of the points, but suffice it to say you are shaking up the family fortunes quite a bit. I don't know if she'll admit it, but our mother went to have tea with grandmama. If only I could have gone.*

*I really wish I could help you more, Vess, with what you are doing. I'll include a book about the sate of magic since the Spellplague with Dad's care package. It was a fascinating read. Spellplague isn't the first time something like this has happened, and seomthing major has changed with the fundamentals of magic each time it has. Whatever you are looking for the book should provide some help, so if you have the time it may be worth the read.*

*I hope things are going a little better with your group. I can at least sympathise with your comparing yourself to your group. I hate talking with elvish scholars; they always one up me in discussions. If I had another 100 years I could have told you all about Silverymoon's unique aqueduct structure as well, Fenryl. Seriously though, you have powers they never will no matter their talents. That is your strength and you should be proud of that. Even more seriously though, don't be putting your life into the hands of people you can't trust even if they are capable, Vess. Please. Whatever it is you've moved on to doing has drawn the attention of King Nasher himself, and as extraordianry as that is it puts you in danger. Gods know Voislav and Kazkalina won't listen to me talk about _Before the Ages of Men: An Archaeological Account of the Creator Races_.*

*Silverymoon suffers from your absence, sister. I hope to see you soon.*

*With love,*  
*Miro*
