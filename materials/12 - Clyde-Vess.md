# Letter to Vess from Clyde Tchurminov

Packaged with a box of sealed vanilla beans, [Miro's letter], and a [book].

*Vesna,*

*I’ll be honest out of all my children I expected you to take the least interest in our business affairs. Not that we ever minded if you didn't, Voislav and Kazkalina alone are enough to keep the cogs working, but suddenly now the family is raving that you are are Vek’s heir apparent. Not long after receiving your letter we received envoys from the Silverthorns about opening a trade route with them trading ore between Neverwinter and Silverymoon. Not just iron mind you, they wanted us to be their first partners in mithril trade. Also apparently your doing.*

*We were getting ready to send you word back when a dinner invitation to the Neverwinter embassy arrived. The entire Tchurminska clan was invited. Do you know who we met there? It was the crown prince of Neverwinter that’s who. We were being wined and dined by foreign royalty, for your services rendered to Neverwinter. We’re not exactly next door neighbors but they wished to offer our caravans us non-taxed passage on the Triboar trail into Neverwinter. The fastest growing economy in the Lord’s Alliance just asked us for exclusive rights on their roads. Your grandmother was so impressed that she invited your mother to tea. Voluntarily.*

*I thought that would be the end of it all for at least another fortnight but the family got one more letter. Lord Hector of Highcliffe wrote to us about cult activity in Neverwinter that he was investigating, and he bid us to be extremely cautious as he fears it’s influence may spread. I’ve met this lord’s father, Eliwood, and truth be told I thought I was talking to a construct until I saw him with his wife. What I mean is that they are a serious bunch, and if they’re sending warnings this far I believe them.  Vess you’ve always been a survivor but I hope your not getting wrapped up in this. Ten years we thought we’d never see you again, but you did make it back. None of us want to go through that again, and I doubt Tymora’s luck could make you pull that off a second time. Please come home to us, we all miss you. Wherever you may be, know that we all love and miss you.*

*Waukeen bring you fortune,*

*Clyde,*  
*Bilyana,*  
*Voislav,*  
*Kazkalina,*  
*Miro,*  
*Danica*
