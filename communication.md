## Me, Budde

#### Pre-campaign setup

**Brad:** What peples live around Neverwinter or farther north?

**Mitch:** The city itself is one of the most cosmopolitan on the continent boast a rather diverse population demografic. To the north there are the Uthgard tribes (some of which have 'civilized' since unification) which are humans and half-orcs and to the south are largely human lands but a good amount of dwarves and respectable population of elves. Way north is the port town of Luskan which is made up of Illuskan (a human sub group) raiders and the arcane brotherhood which accepts any members (though it is an evil organization).

**Brad:** Do the druids in Faerun have any sort of society, hierarchy, or politics?

**Mitch:** Different circle have different rules. The druids in Neverwinter usually belong to the Circle of the Sword and there is a hierarchy of elders who make decisions that druids carry out with an Archdruid at the head.

**Brad:** 13,13,13,15,15,16  
Everything within 4 of eachother, and five of them were odd.

**Mitch:** Haha very nice. You going druid?

**Brad:**Yep, Human circle of the moon (mechanically)

**Mitch:** Unless you're a particularly social druid this probably hasn't been a huge deal but most people wouldn't differentiate between your magic and arcane so you know to be careful with who knows of your abilities. @

**Brad:** Ah, interesting. That changes some minor things. So clerics probably only avoid suspicion by being very obviously godly?

**Mitch:** Yeah. Holy symbols and all. Some crafter caster masquerade using divine symbols as casting foci. This is incredibly dangerous as it is seen as heretical by all but gods of magic.  
Crafty casters*

**Brad:** Would being very ostensibly devoted to a nature deity give me the best of both worlds? I'd seem like a cleric to the ignorant, but the informed wouldn't consider it blaspheming?

**Mitch:** That would probably fly for everyone but people who hate that God (which shouldn't be a ton) Many will see you as an ignorant savage to an extent though (unless that doesn't quite mesh with what you want).

**Brad:** I think I'd prefer it.

**Mitch:** Perfect. I was going to start you in Highcliffe so if there's any roll playing you need to do let me know or include it in your backstory.

**Brad:** So I'm pretty sure I have the majority of what I want the character to be, I'm just missing anything that would make them interesting. As it stands now, she's a younger daughter of a northern noble family who left to become a druid sometime in adolescence (don't know why, yet). She eventually had a falling out with the Circle of Swords over how to deal with civilization encroaching upon nature: she thinks that diplomacy and technological advancement can be used to keep civilization contained and dense, where violence will probably just encourage razing forests to remove all the scary druids. She's willing to accept that now is maybe not the best time for pushing revolutionary policy reform, however, and hopes that maybe if she helps clear out all the dead people and lizardfolk then Neverwinter can manage at least a few years without earth-shattering, apocalyptic events.  
Still not sure of her gender. She was originally a women, but then I didn't notice as I started to think of her as a man, and I just now remembered all the reasons she wasn't going to be one.  
If you have any ideas for an impressive, German-sounding last name I'd appreciate hearing them.

**Mitch:** Perfect timing I was about to send you some more information on the druids of the North. And I'll try and think of some names as well.

**Mitch:** The druid circle plays a role in this plot so some things to consider (and if this doesn't work with what you had in mind we can work to make it fit): the Circle of swords has become very insular since the Spellplague and has broken off into two "factions". To the south is the Circle of the Mere which tends to lands of the Mere of Dead Men and to the north is the Circle of the Wood which keeps to the Neverwinter Woods. They say the spit was due to a schism between the two highest ranking druids after the death of the last Arch Druid during the Luskan War. Elder Vashne left with a small cadre of druids and went into exile in the swamp while Elder Naevan kept a more traditional touch within the Neverwinter wood. No new arch druid has been named.

**Brad:** The factions don't claim their own elder is Archdruid?

**Mitch:** Kaiser, Volsung, KÃ¶hler, Hapsburg for names.

**Mitch:** As far as you can tell neither wants to take that step as it would mean the other circle was truly lost to them. Most members hope the Circle can be restored.

**Mitch:** As to their beliefs Vashne thinks the druids should allow the lands to change and they should change to mirror the lands. Naevan takes a traditional approach as trying to keep everything preserved as is.

**Brad:** What sort of change? Do they allow forests to be cut down for lumber and farmland, or do you mean the more godly, apocalyptic changes?

**Mitch:** It's kept somewhat vague buy Vashne explains that he chose the Mere as his home because it's the perfect example of what he means. It used to be a small swamp region but there was a terrible battle between orcs dwarves and elves that took place there. Such was the carnage to the land that the swamp grew and gained it's new name. He wants druids to emulate that kind of change. Take that as you will.

**Brad:** Compared to the present, when was the end of the spellplague and when was the Archdruid's death?

**Mitch:** I'm at ASI so I don't have my timeline but Spellplague ended roughly 16 years ago and the Archdruid died 19-20 years ago.

**Mitch:** I was off by quite a bit. Archdruid died 30 years ago, and Spellplague ended 7 years ago.

**Brad:** For people not directly related to the arcane, was the end of the spellplague important? Was life during the spellplague more dangerous or anything?

**Mitch:** In some places there were devestating natural disasters and many kingdoms were thrown into chaos following the loss of magic networks but for the average Joe farmer not really.

**Brad:** Is the nobility in the region the usual patriarchal primogeniture?

**Mitch:** Among the humans that is the norm, but not so with the elven and dwarven people, because they are above such pettiness.

**Brad:** You don't bother with individual human languages, do you?  
Is Silverymoon currently both stable and relevant to Neverwinter-area politics?

**Mitch:** Silverymoon is a part of the Lord's Alliance and is an ally and trade partner to Neverwinter. I haven't done a ton with human languages outside of common but I may work Illuskan into some of the dungeons.

**Brad:** When you talk about the Spellplague ending, you're referring to when most things became normal, not the true end, yes? 1395DR?

**Mitch:** Correct

**Brad:** How strict do you want me to be on the "beast you've seen before" requirement of Beast Shape?  
What am I to do for gear? Most importantly, what sort of natural armor exists outside of the basic hide armor? Are there any special wooden armors?  
Is there anything happening at Highcliff that I would have noticed upon arrival? Or anything else that I need to do to join the group?  
Do you mind if Beast Shape lasts half my level, rather than rounding down to the hour? Half an hour is a pretty significant amount of time, and I feel like they just rounded because they're used to rounding everything.  
Here's an outline of my character: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0xW8_AvJT5YI3cHPV3UYTs-LmVvTvXCzA0sYCXf21Q/edit?usp=sharing

**Mitch:** [Like]  
I don't remember sending you that thumbs up but here we are.  
Armor: There is such a thing as ironwood though few smiths would know how to work it, but you could craft heavier armors with that.  
Highcliffe: The village is more or less under siege by lizardfolk fleeing the Mere. Any ships that try to leave the city are sunk and anyone who leaves over land without a heavily armed guard are attacked on the roads. The farms have been largely abandoned and Highcliffe will starve out without the sea trade.  
Start with the standard equipment and gp. You can have something of masterwork quality or any non-magic object of gp value 100 or less (unless there is a magic item that REALLY fits with your backstory).

**Brad:** Oh, and this is 5e, right?

**Mitch:** Correct, 5e. I'm fine with how you want to round it beast shape. You must have seen the animal, OR you've studied that animal from an anatomical text (or special druid scroll or whatever). It can't have just been a picture or painting.

**Mitch:** One more thing about the druid though they have split they do meet once a year during a time sacred to Silvanus so you have a passing familiarity with the whole Circle of Swords. You know for the past few years crops have been failing near the Mere though why is unknown. A possible hook for you is you may have run into the Mere druid Elanee who believes that a traveling group may be involved somehow in all this (she doesn't blame them though).

**Brad:** Would that be a time when people mingle and can share ideas and philosophy, or is it mainly pomp and tradition and trying to poach others to your circle is frowned upon? w

**Mitch:** More of the former. There are important rituals that need to be performed to keep the forest of Neverwinter healthy as well  
If you do take the Elanee route let me know because she would share some details with you.

**Brad:** I definitely will take that route. I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with Vess having talked with druids from the Mere. I think things will work smoother if she isn't a part of the circle, but I need more info about their views before I can justify that. Might require roleplay.  
Have you looked into free copies of tabletop simulator?

**Mitch:** Sorry they were out. But If you want I will gift you a copy. Elanee recently made contact with the group but they turned down her offer of aid. She tells you that she was assigned the region of the Mere that West Harbor sits upon. She was too late to help but she saw the aftermath of a slaughter there and this group leaving the village with a powerful magical artifact of some sort. They've been consistently attacked by outsiders since leaving. She thinks this magic item is tied to the spreading blight from the mere. She's been worried that you're the first druid she's seen since the last yearly meeting and she's going to search for Elder Vashne or any other members of her circle

**Brad:** Does she have a description of the group and the artifact?

**Mitch:** The artifact had to be small because they kept it wrapped in a silk bundle. The one carrying the shard was a half-orc tall and thin for his kind. He wore a chain shirt or mithril and could be quite abrasive. There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort and used a bow. He seemed more naive and a bit meek. The final member was a dwarf female who wore no armor and used a specialized axe in combat. She bore many scars and took a strong disliking to Elanee though she knew not why. @

**Brad:** Elanee didn't know why, right?  
And when you say she was assigned this portion of the mere, you mean that she was told to investigate that area? How long ago was she instructed to do that?

**Mitch:** No she's been tending to the life in that area for many years. Since the schism.

**Brad:** So Elashnee only took an interest in them after seeing them leave the village? Does she have any evidence that they aren't involved, or is she just going off of gut? Does she seem like the naive, trusting type?

**Mitch:** Correct. Going off gut. Depends on how shallow your character is. Based on her looks she seems to be a very young elf, but she doesn't seem to have that air of naivete about her. Even if they aren't involved directly with the growing blight the presence of outsiders is worry some.

**Brad:** Do you have a plan for introducing me?

**Mitch:** I can force it if need be easily enough but I'll try and make and set the scene so you're all in Highcliffe together.

**Brad:** I'd ask Elanee if there's any place I can find her at if I need to contact her in the future, and I'll tell her that I'll do the best I can to leave messages for her that contain any information I find.  
I'm taking this really seriously and I feel like if this actually happened I wouldn't be trusted and it would fail, but I'm 90% sure that the other players are going to go "Oh, this is another PC" and immediately trust me enough to let me overhear something.  
Do spectacles exist?

**Mitch:** Elanee was going to Ereadis (The Maiden's Glade) south of Highcliffe and that if you needed to communicate you could find her or leave her information there.  
As far as roleplaying goes for the beginning bit I'll have you do rolls and things over text (unless you are fine with the metagame of them knowing). There might be some "let the pc join" mentality but I think this will be interesting to see it play out.  
Spectacles are in their infancy but do exist.  
Usually they are held or rest on the bridge of the nose without earwraps.

**Brad:** There isn't some sort of 'whisper' functionality to Tabletop Simulator?

**Mitch:** Maybe? It hasn't come up before so I'e never checked.  
Looks like there is a way to whisper

**Brad:** Using an actual keyboard would be nicer than texting. Or we could do facebook messages, but that probably isn't as nice if you have only 1 monitor.

**Mitch:** If it works I'm fine with doing it in game. Facebook can be the fall back. Hopefully it won't take all session to get you joined though.

**Brad:** So when is this happening?

**Mitch:** We start at 5:30.  I usually try and start hosting the session at 5:15 or so and get everyone on skype.

**Brad:** "There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort"  
As in bard magic? I just noticed this and don't know whether you accidentally gave me extra info.

**Mitch:** Bard is a general term in Faerun. It was more that he had access to magical power.

**Brad:** Gotcha.

#### First Session: Finding the party in Highcliffe and attacking a castle


**Mitch:** Can I get your Skype info?

**Brad:** Brad.aylsworth@gmail.com

**Brad:** I think

**Brad:** What would the penalties be for not having proper winter gear?  
Is it possible for a carriage/wagon to make it through the Neverwinter Wood?  
Can a hunter a make a living in the Neverwinter Wood, considering the druids there?

**Mitch:** Depends on the winter. I thought this would be just a mechanic to get the party to consider extreme weather conditions. I know it talks about it in the phb somewhere.

**Brad:** Vess will put on her furs as soon as she gets back to her cache of stuff in Highcliffe, but she still just has the normal leather armor.  
I guess it's in the DMG, page 110.

**Mitch:** Ah. She has been pretty cold then haha.

**Brad:** I never know how to talk about alll the tiny, fiddly things I do for roleplay

**Mitch:** It's ok to bring it up. We go through a ton of rp anyway so take the time to say something!

**Brad:** And the Neverwinter Wood questions?

**Brad:** There are a few roads that go through the wood but a nature spirit has prevented passage since the end of the war with luskan.

**Brad:** Did Elanee really only see the three of them, not four?

**Mitch:** She saw a fourth when they left but he then left the group and there were only 3 when she met them

**Brad:** I wanted to reread the history thing you made, so I decided I might as well proofread it. If you care, here it is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWgPKfxBQpeAenfPoMWOUAcMixVaAbTjb6I6FmlvC8M/edit?usp=sharing  
TL;DR: We write very similarly, with both of us trying to fit way too much information into a single sentence. The difference being that you really hate commas.  
Also, Uthgardt.

**Mitch:** I really appreciate it. You'd think if this was something I was going to share I would have taken the time to check it, but I basically finished and sent it out.

**Brad:** It was readable, and that's all that really matters. There are so many better ways for you to spend your time.

**Mitch:** True. Was it helpful in getting a feel for the setting?

**Brad:** It was a good read. It didn't really focus on the things I am most curious about, but that's probably for the best. What I found most interesting was the things that conflict with what I've previously read about Faerun, but in ways that seem realistic. Like "Never's Winter"; I'm pretty sure I've read things before which say that Neverwinter is so named because the Neverwinter River keeps it warm even during the winter.

**Mitch:** There several given reasons for the name Neverwinter, but the game canon differs in that it was a magical artifact called the source stone that kept the city warm. It was destroyed during the last war and so now the city suffers harsh winter's like the rest of the country.

#### Second Session: Treating with the Lizardfolk


**Brad:** Outside the city I'm going to dig up a cache of my belongings, and then send one Animal Messenger to Elanee and one to my family.

**Mitch:** Ok.

**Brad:** Would you consider studded leather to be "armor made of metal"? I think regardless Vess is going to at least be uncomfortable with it, but if she's able to I think she'd wear it when she's worried she'd need the enchantment bonus. Otherwise it isn't any better than the hide armor I was going to switch to.  
And nevermind about the whole Vess not wearing warm enough armor. I need to stop trying to do really subtle things for characterization, and be willing to either make a big deal out of it or just not do it.

**Mitch:** Druids have, as far as I know, always been able to wear studded leather. If you're curious this particular suits studs are of bone not metal.

**Brad:** Huh, I guess that's fine, then. That's pretty metal.  
Which is an ironic turn of phrase, come to think of it.

**Mitch:** Very true haha

**Brad:** Do the Roysons exist outside of this campaign, or has the NWN2 party run into them before? I feel like I've seen or heard the name somewhere, but I can't find it.

**Mitch:** I've never mentioned the family before. When I was coming up with the lords names I literally stared mashing FE lords together because in my mind that just sounded hilarious. Hector Royson is a combination of Hector from FE7 and Roy from FE6.

**Brad:** I was guessing that was where Hector came from, but now I wonder why I'm so certain I saw "Royson" somewhere.  
I'm typing up what Vess put in the messages and letter, and then I'm going to try and finish up my revision of her background info. If you have any idea of how to organize it all I'd be happy to hear it, but for now I'm just going to throw it all in that google doc.

**Mitch:** Hmm I'm not sure. The Google Doc is fine.

**Brad:** I misread Animal Messenger, and I guess it couldn't reach Silverymoon unless I cast it as a sixth-level spell. Druids really get shafted when it comes to long-range communication and teleportation.

**Mitch:** Yeah. That's always been more of an Arcane caster benefit.

**Brad:** But even clerics get sending. Though it looks like the closest thing they get to a teleport is "astral projection" at 9th level.  
I also just realized that Vess has been accruing names and I've completely failed to explain any of them to you, so a quick rundown:  
Her family name is Tchurminov. Translated literally from Damaran it means "winterprison", and she occasionally refers to herself that way because she thinks the name is ridiculous. Her surname is Tchurminska because Damaran surnames have a feminine and masculine form, so all women of her family are named Tchurminska. The family makes a point to adhere to this tradition even in lands where it's unheard of, though Vess occasionally goes against it if she believes clarity is more important. Her given name is Vesna, but she tends to go by Vess, the nickname given to her by her brother Miro.

##### Neverwinter nobility discussion


**Brad:** So I want Vess to have a friend in Neverwinter politics who is sympathetic to her goals, but they wouldn't sacrifice anything personally/politically in order to help her. I'm guessing the Neverwinter nobility is pretty important to this campaign, so I don't want to step on your toes and just make something up like with Silverymoon.

**Mitch:** I can make that fit in pretty easily. Do you have a preference with a southern lord or the city nobility?

**Brad:** City nobility  
And if you have a candidate in mind, or guidelines, it would be great to hear them. I always feel better making a character when I have something to work off of.

**Mitch:** Noble titles within the city are awarded based on merit as decided by the current ruler. This can be for great mercantile acumen, diplomatic skill, or martial prowess to name a few  (or a combination of feats) so long as they greatly benefit the city in an impactful way. While the titles are hereditary because of the merit based system it is frowned upon to rest on your family laurels. Not only could you be one upped but because rulership of the city had not been hereditary before you wanted to be in good standing with whomever would take over or be in a position to rule yourself. The crown acts as the excutive branch and final arbiter of any decision making but there is a council of nobles that handles day to day affairs in the city and funds a large portion of the crowns expenditures.  
If you want to craft a house from that you may or give me an idea and I will get to work on my imagination canvas.

**Brad:** So is it common to have people's titles stripped if they don't work for it?  
Also, I'm probably thinking some sort of dwarf.

**Mitch:** Not really stripped unless they anger the crown or council. More they just lose relevance, coin, and status. Eventually they just aren't allowed in the same circles. But because they weren't stripped of anything it's easier to reverse their fortunes back to what they were before.

**Brad:** Unrelated, but do the country nobility not have to worry so much about that?

**Mitch:** They do but it's a new situation because Unification just happened and Nasher hasn't dared strip anyone of their title despite some houses defying his orders. Prior to unification landowners would swear fealty to the most powerful landowners accepting their rule in return for protection creating a noble house. These houses in turn swore fealty to the most powerful house in a greater region creating a great house that rules a provenance. Theoretically landowners could simply strip these houses of their power but the houses that exist now are entrenched in the culture and that is unlikely to happen.  
Provence*  
For example the lords you met on the fields of Highcliffe were vassals of House Greymane. A new addition to the nobility were the Wardens. Chosen great houses were chosen to administrate the lands to the north and south of Neverwinter.

**Brad:** *province  
Though I think provenance actually makes sense in that context as well.

**Mitch:** God I'm terrible. Semi unrelated but I wrote a short story about Kjarl Greymane for Jake because he wanted to know what happened and to fill him in on during the long night. It's supplementary but I could send it to you if you wanted when I get home. It's something I actually spent time on and I wouldn't mind a critique if nothing else.

**Brad:** I'd be interested in seeing it. THe more I can learn about nobility, the better.

**Mitch:** Sweet. It doesn't focus a ton on that more a character snapshot of an important NPC and some closure for Jakes former character Anthem.

**Brad:** I mean that for Vess in general, the more I can learn about nobility and important nobles, the better.

**Mitch:** Ah gotcha.  
There is a small stratification in the nobility of the city. Those who perform great martial deeds are knighted gaining the tile Sir and have the ability to squire and knight others. People who perform other more cerebral deeds are called lords and have more power than knights because they tend to be more rare and they can't name new lords though they can nominate people to the crown. The Court Mage has the same power as a knight.

**Brad:** Arcane mage?

**Mitch:** Yup. The king retains a court wizard to consult over arcane matters.

**Brad:** I'm assuming that was vacant during the Spellplague?

**Mitch:** Correct.

#### Third Session: Sailing to Neverwinter


**Brad:** I can read lips, so I'm pretty sure that on the ship towards the end I caught something about them having a mission that they haven't told me about. I don't think they actually said anything in particular about it, except for maybe mentioning a name or two.

**Mitch:** That is a fair assessment of what your character caught.

**Brad:** Have you used that link? I'm not seeing any of you pop up in the members section of my server.

**Mitch:** Should show up as By-tor

**Brad:** There we go.

#### Fourth session: ?

**Brad:** We doing D&D tonight?

**Mitch:** We will not.

#### Fifth session: ?

#### Sixth session: Starting a gang war and leaving Neverwinter


**Mitch:** The day that you left to visit the archives a falcon arrived bearing a letter addressed to you:
  
Dear Lady Vess,  
I hope that Peregrin finds you in good health. This is Lord Hector Royson, we met briefly in Highcliffe concerning the lizardfolk. I said that I would keep you in the loop concerning matters in the south and I mean to keep that promise. Despite their grousing the southern lords have calmed down over the relocation of the lizardfolk, and they in turn have acclimated well to their new home. I think you would appreciate how far they've come in such a short amount of time. Every challenge that's been thrown their way they've surmounted, whether it be bandits or keeping the Llyn Dinas from freezing over (the magic that their shamans employ is fascinating!). I have been working closely with Slaan, as their chieftain has gone on some sort of spiritual quest in search of answers. To what they will not tell me more on, but for the meantime I trust in our new allies.
  
The southern great houses have become even more insular of late. Even my lord father has been in close contact with only a few of our allies. As of yet he has not confided what is brewing, but I beg of you  
 to be careful in Neverwinter. I fear that the southern lords are not the only actors in this little play. I have looked more into the allegations of this necrotic cult but found very little. After your friends actions at Fort Locke and Castle Highcliffe it seems they have gone to ground. I will of course keep my eyes and ears open to more news.
  
A final matter. I realize that your path has led you to Neverwinter, and that you have matters of your own to pursue, but I would be delighted if you would visit me and my family at Castle Pherae. Consider this an open invitation to you, and if they are interested, your companions.
  
Yours in friendship,  
Hector

**Brad:** This happened in the morning, before we left?  
Weird thought: What is Peregrin like? Vess will take some time to take care of it, try petting it, etc. Is it well-behaved? Impatient? Quarrelsome? If you want rolls, Vess takes 10 for either 18 insight or 15 animal handling.

**Mitch:** Yes, it arrived around 5 in the morning. It was incredibly well behaved and if it could be described as having a personality a bit aloof and very pround. The feathers on its forehead seemed to for some kind of arcane symbol. It accepts whatever care you give but seems to want to head back, you sense a small amount of impatience from it.  
Your biggest concern with its care would be the cold conditions it had to travel through, though it seems to be warming at quick rate.

**Brad:** I mainly meant rest and food.  
The symbol doesn't seem natural, but it's made out of the coloration of the birds feathers? Not painted on or branded?  
Vess will write out a quick letter, and as she does she's going to ask it how long it travelled, in Common and then by casting Speak with Animals if it doesn't understand.

**Mitch:** The coloration. You can make a history check if you want. You cast speak with animals and it reply that it has been flying for about a week directly from Hector.

**Brad:** Nat 20 + 4

**Mitch:** You recognize this breed falcon as having magical alterations done to them long ago to give them natural divination powers making them the perfect messengers. Given a name they can find any person on that plane of existence and they are on, and are almost impossible to intercept as they can predict an ambush before it happens. They are rare and usually retained by royal familys.

**Brad:** I seal the note, slip it into whatever it uses to carry them, and give it a formal thanks/acknowledgement of its work.  
Would you be willing to help me straighten out Vess's adventure log, focusing on how time passed? I started keeping track of the actual calendar in the last session (I'm guessing you did too from something you said) but I don't remember previous sessions well enough to be certain of how many days this has all taken.

**Mitch:** I've been somewhat vague on time until arriving in Neverwinter. You arrived on January first and your whole boat trip took a full week. You have now spent 10 days in Neverwinter.

**Brad:** Good you cleared that up, at least. I thought you had said last session we'd hit January 1st.

**Mitch:** Shit you're right. That was my goof. It is canonically January 11th right now.  
Neverwinter was celebrating my birthday that day before. Canon.

**Brad:** So do you mean that we fell out of the Astral Plane on the first, then spent a week travelling and on the January 7th we hit actual Neverwinter harbor?
