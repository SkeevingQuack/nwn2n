## Session

Vess showed Balthazar some aquatic forms and buys some components.

day passes

A powerful mage named Aldenon is missing, and Elootra sends Galleon to investigate. It seems Aldenon was corresponding with Black Garius and also was working on soul welding. 

Vess and Balthazar and Kail manage an 8-hour cast of plant growth, then are summoned.

We're teleported to a clearing in a forest with some tents. We get prepped, then were led to the cave entrance. We killed the guards at the cave, meeting Ordo(?). Galleon decides he wants to start branding ne'er-do-wells with a phoenix. Some weird, old dude has been packing the caves with monsters.

Monsters include a giant metal spider. Also, apparently, a water weird. Also corpses of umber hulks and a metal spider. 



We found Aldenon in a library at the end of the cave. Confirmed that he's helping Black Garius. Aldenon has no spellcasting.
