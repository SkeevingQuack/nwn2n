Balthazar going by Twinrel

“Throw out house tan at the behest of anton Valais”

Moira sees herself as a revolutionary, has a “benefactor” who deals with all kinds.

Zentarum, Luskan, and local gangs in the docks; pushed out by this gang. Supposedly this gang is pacifying cutthroat businesses and a lot of street crime. Moira admits that she’s not entirely altruistic in her endeavors. 

Old Owl Well -- all travel through mere delain stopped, Nasher sent envoys to waterdeep for a route that travels through mountains and requires the OOW. Ambassador Asani has gone missing somewhere between mountains and OOW. Perished or captured. Ambassador’s contact in Neverwinter has disappeared and

Send to Lord Ajax for Moira. Ajax isn’t really a part of it, but his merchant friends are in cahoots. 

Balthazar’s family (Twinrels) was attacked and maybe enslaved. Moira suggests Ronel family, friends of Valiss family (I think Valiss is the people who may have enslaved them). Both are powerful noble families. 

Definitely is Moira, she was suspicious of Caleb’s loyalties. 

Kenka that make the sound of two coins dropping. 

Valiss family lost its land and moved onto Roenel lands. Both are vocal opponents of Nasher’s rule in the South. 

(Greymanes have been extinguished, and their region has no great house. All minor nobilities turned down offers, saying that Greymane’s daughter is alive and will take her seat.) 

Moira only refers to it as a single murder/assassination; doesn’t seem to know anything else but is “interested” in it. 

This happens super late at night. 

(Father and sister of Balthazar are alive, being carted around as slaves. They’re avoiding Castle Ostia and/or Pherae, travelling east)

Neverwinter along the coast to the Mere of Dead Men is 500 miles.
