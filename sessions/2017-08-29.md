## Pre-session reminders

## Session notes

Cobble-stoned road in a forest. We see a very strange human child who has been having visions of us, and proves it by describing those not there. Dimirrodin "wears the face of the Butcher of Ember". We're near Ember, and the enemy is up in those hills. 

Child decides to look through Dimirrodin's pack since he believes it contains something that will save his life. He chooses a mundane dagger that Dimirrodin reacts strangely to. Then we part ways.

Gyvan of the Road, a halfling, was tied up. He was going to look into these Ilfarn ruins, but was captured by githyanki. They then got a call, talked about the Kalek-cha, and went into the cave. 

We find the githyanki who was apparently the big cheese on the boat. He is wearing less important clothing, and he's *pissed* at Dimirrodin.

It is a shitshow. We see some sort of battle between succubi, githyanki, and golems. 

We decide to probably sleep for the night.
