Katulmak -- orcish honorific for their enemies. Generally only refers to specific other orcs. Apparently some dude who has been defending the OOW for a decade. They take our weapons and armor, but I keep my cane.

Asani is in Lowgrum’s dungeons. Augur of Gruumsh is the super old dude.

They separate the party by gender on boats. Rest in some sort of cave (1 day).

Early evening, we make it to stronghold. “Penton” is already there, was lead miner with the Silverthorns. Asani is a human. 

Augur is on our side, probably because Gruumsh showed favor on Balthazar.
