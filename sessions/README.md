## Uncertain notes

#### either it's a summary or these are from 2017-04-10

Hector Royson is the noble I like. 

Dimirrodin seems to be Kalek-cha ~ “Relic thief”

Silverthorne family - Umigrem? Maugrim

They’re looking for Duncan at the Sunken Flagon. Had a message from his half-brother Dagon(?) to speak with him. Duncan is a wood-elf. Dagon raised Dimirrodin. 

West Harbor was attacked by duergar and monkey things, searching for something. (DM then handwaved the rest of the explanation). Dimirrodin has a shard in a towel (Esmerella and the Silver Shard), seems to be what they’re after and if the shards are reunited something will happen. 

Sand is Duncan’s group’s mage, likes to smell things. Shard reacts violently to identify spells.


Edric is stuck as a wolf  
Vashnee or maybe Naven - circle of skymere?

Marchsall McCormick talks about loss of Galen. Entreats us to guard a shopkeep (Logan) while they root out agents of gangs. Given Watch cloaks. 

Thieves working for Caleb. Guards suspect people named “Caleb” or “Moira”

We killed Caleb, probably. Moira seemed to be the real boss. She showed up with a small army, and declared “This means war”. 

Drow refugees because of Neverwinter Rift?

Guild is “unweavers”
