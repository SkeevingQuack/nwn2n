Eileen, Lina, (his dad)

Hector said he’d tell Silverthorns about the mithril mine, pulled me aside and gave me the amulet of Tyr, promised to look into things and keep up correspondence with Peregrin. He was going to wait in Phandolin with the refugees and try to resettle them around his lands, as soon as Eliwood sent an escort.

Amulet of Tyr: (Greater) Restoration once per day;

Go down to town, go to bed again.

Ride three days to reach the pass at noonish. Saw the remains of a battle that went poorly for the defenders (Southern House guards, and main army. Orcs and bugbears were the attackers)

Four more days, hear a super loud argument in Dwarven. “Dammit I’m an Ironfist”, “That’s not what you chose, Kelgar” Kelgar arguing with 4 dwarves. 

Ironfist scouts think they’ve found a clanhold but it’s taken by bugbears. Alassi speaks up for Kelgar and even curtsies. 

Vess speaks in Dwarven. We head south to try and find the lost scout.

Kelgar has seen black-robes(white masks) helping the orcs and such to fight. 

We found the corpse, and just the stupidest bugbears ambushed us. We sorta captured one named Klarg and got the information from him. Hierarchy: Grauch -> Gruum -> Klarg & friends

We saved Kharyar Ironfist from being boiled.

We seem to find the Ironfist Keep,
