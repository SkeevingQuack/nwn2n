Succubi are apparently strictly demonic, and the succubi were fighting alongside imps. 

Kail, a halfling in full plate, 3'2", very short but very muscular, heavily battlescarred, light-green and coiffed hair. Coming from Luskan, was diverted by a Dawnbringer. Ruby on the chest of his full plate.

Tall, black but not super long hair, very present. 

Tyta is an aaracokra waiting in the cave, intent on fighting the things in it. 

Devil in the circle looks like a handsome, pale elf in flowy robes. It says it wants us to release it from its bonds and master, which would let us get past the wall and would be helpful. His master is searching for silver shards of a broken blade.  Zieri is the leader of the gith of this compound ("the last stronghold of the sword hunters"). Time limit of "Zaxis finishes his job". 

He will give us a portion of his true name in order to force him to destroy the circle. He says his master is our true enemy. A hezro is trying to break into the sanctum to kill Zieri. 

Mephasm is his partial name.

Zaxis is the "hezro" demon breaking down the door.

Tyta: "Death to the defiler!" as Zieri dies. 

Tentacles are a gift from the "Moonmother".
