Orcs use eagle calls to communicate, as told to us by Urg the orc smith. 

Ordo was in Sanctuary region of Neverwinter, and the necromancer people hired him to guard these ruins. People in robes want a bloody war, any bloody war. Supposed to take orders from Logrim or Yaisog. Necromancers were funding the orcs for the war, as long as they didn’t eat the dead people. Lowgrum is all about the shadows, Yaisog is about the old ways, now there’s internal strife. 

Reminder: Asani is the Waterdeep emissary

1 day ends
2nd day is ending, we see an encampment and fucking obliterate them.
3rd day around noon: We see Old Owl Well keep, see a man and woman fighting outside it. Man introduces himself as Sir Oswin Kane (squire woman (Aliss) called him Grayson)

He thinks we were sent by Berlayna and introduces us to Sir Kallum. We tell him that he should send Asani to Berlayna, though with some more discussion it seems he thinks the new Lord Ajax is a good man, though pompous. Ronel and Valis have renegged on sending reinforcements. They’ve found Yaisog Bonegnasher and think we can take him. (Lowgrum is the true leader, but Lowgrum has thrown in with shadow priests). Hundreds of tribes working together for a decade under Lowgrum, which is unprecedented in modern times. 

Halfling woman named Simee is quartermaster/shopkeep. She knows the Tchurminovs and seems to have worked with them and thinks well of them. The Kingslayers are a set of daggers that are infamous assassination tools (Anguish and Sorrow). She says that Ironbark comes from the Neverwinter forest, but lately an owl has been protecting it. The Kingslayers are supposedly in Neverwinter at the moment. She’ll stick around two more days, and then does her week elsewhere before she comes back to OOW.

Lady Aliss ($BeratedWoman) is a teenager, full armor, jet black hair (probably dyed), is whaling away on a dummy. We ignore. 

Peregrin comes later, and Vess sends a response that night.

4th day: Lure a troll into an orc encampment and kill them, find a locket with a portrait of a woman. Blow the fuck up out of a cave and almost die. Go to sleep
