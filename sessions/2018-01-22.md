Marx: Liriel's Theater Troupe is the handler of the three in Phandalin. Supposedly they do a lot of this sort of thing. The clients paid a lot and Liriel's Theater Troupe might be in Roenel.

Nasher: Attacked from the east by undead gith and others, Adelbert saved him. Elootra hasn't been found. He's worried about internal spies.

Adelbert Alagundar: Nasher seems to be acting un-father-like, they had him for an hour without anyone else around. Anthem's Tower crushed the village of "Hannleaf". 

First day ends

Next day cast find the path (should be found at end of day), while flying we were attacked by undead peryton. We actually make it there at midnight exactly. Galleon and Balthazar have no magic.
