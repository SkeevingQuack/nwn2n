We decide to fly Neverwinter's banner and defer decisions on our own.

We see a single vanguard of House Roe. 4pm.

man with warhammer, female with halfplate, man with mace, attractive man of Valiss. Fat man with squinty eyes and the mage Chanel representing Roe. 

Rupert is a retainer of House Valiss. Chanel's staff has three symbols: mystra, druidic fetish, and a warlock symbol. Walter has the mace and is a dawnbringer. Lady Ellen is a ranger and is high elven. Lord Roe is the squinty man. 

Chanel apparently keeps a lot from Roe as well. Sand doesn't like her, and she pointedly mentioned he studied in Luskan.

[We cede control to Vallis]

Arvahn is maybe occupied. THere's a statue of a woman holding a bowl and a white flame burns in the bowl. Emenates arcane and divine power. There are campfires and a keep.

The campfires are an orc village. The keep has a hobgoblin standing guard. The keep calls it the "City of the Master". Grauwsh the ogre is in there.
