Armnan the high priest is doing some sort of experiment that seems to have stayed stagnant for this whole time.

Armnan is a seemingly living dwarf who has intentionally trapped the undead here. The spooky room is "not its intended effect". 

Ilfarn had fought for many years against the magical empire Netheril who wished to conquer them. Armnan created the "guardian of Ilfarn". The Archmage Krousis of Ilfarn found a way to kill Mystral (1,300years ago) and attempted to seize her mantle, which caused the weave to collapse momentarily. The guardian of Ilfarn ritual was interrupted by this and went wrong. Armnan believes the spooky crack won't disappear until the King of Shadows is gone. 

When the guardian awoke he killed his "foolish woman" (his lover Kiera) and fled. the "Sisters" were sent to kill him, so the guardian took it as Ilfarn's leaders being its own greatest foe and he turned on it. The man who became the King of Shadows was a musician and learned magic. Kiera was known as the Conductor. 

A lone human man (the conductor?) completed the pilgrimmage alone before us, around 20 years ago.

Dwarf woman and human man statues give off radiant energy. Three statues are not, corresponding to the three boons we've gotten.
