## Session

Chandra -> Shandra, Kail Sunpetal, 

Traveling through the portal sent us to somewhere without the Weave. Tall obsidian figure with stark white mask depicted on rug (depiction of King of Shadows as he freed people from Raven Queen); giant stoic sentry.  He is the Knight of Autumn and servant of King of Shadows. Yahagul is this church, definitely in the Shadowfell. 

Church is carved into a mountainside, entire landscape is gray and lifeless. Reliquary has alter depicting black sun shining on a person and one of the weird grim reaper scythes.

Conductor is wearing leather armor but still has his harp. It apparently can end us all with a single pluck. Dimirrodin is around and apparently was partially melded with Logrum? 

Rufus (Ecclisiarch) the Solar? Anthem is introduced by the Solar as successor to Azuth, and there's a super young elf. Opened up the heavens to invasion.





Master of the Swork (Kalek-cha) is on their side. 

Kail will find his aasimar "6 turns of the clock" after he survives this. 

Elootra, Sir Oswin Cain, Aliss Ratsel, Hector, Sir Nebal of the Neverwinter Nine

"2 weeks ago"

Wondering if ever been to a town named Ember. Everyone butchered, everything burned. It was apparently done by us. Nebal was the one who interrogated us.

Nebal (Neval?) is the only one who joins us with Nasher. Tyta won't bow to a mortal king. Qwigon died just a few nights ago.  Lord Taverick is only remaining one. They attack with demons and devils, always after 22:00. Guards led by Cpt. Blackballard.
