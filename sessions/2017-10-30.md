Two people came through teleportation circle.

Humanoid sitting on throne is black humanoid. White and purple mask, almost glowing eyes. Ahliera next to him, and Shadala on the other side. Dude's very composed. Ahliera gives cloak to Galleon. Azazel is the moniker he gives himself (that name is not famous in Faerun as it is IRL). 

A few years before spellplague A fell out with another wizard. Wiz was oing research but excluded A from the end result and warded against Az and Az's agents. Az can get us into the vastest vaults in Sword Coast if we can reduce the wards. Apparently Wiz is Anthem.

Specifically Unlock the Wards and find a grimoire on the transmutation of souls. Az thinks cloning is how Anthem survived the spellplague. Az would finance our entire keep. He has deep attachments to the dragon cults.

Ahliera offers to shoot someone for Aliss. 

Belcourt, Windemeer, Laredes, Solden? are the smaller houses round here. South could probably rival the crown in power. 

**Fortnight 2**

Road security is awful, and there are petitioners.

Merchant Reggie is annoyed at having been robbed by bandits on the Highroad. 5 miles south of here and went to the west. Balthazar pays 1000 and promises the another 1000 within a month. 25 soldiers and McCormick and Balthazar to deal with the bandits. 

Human Darred, halfling sorcerer, gnome cleric, and tiefling bard. Darin's a huge fan of the ~~Conductors~~ Keepers. They're looking for a quest and Aliss mentions that there's maybe a Luskan spy in Port Llast.

Pathfinder Willem mentioned that there's a nearby town called Leaves. Ziffer was the mayor, and he wants us to officially re-sign the town's charter. Leaves is a mile away. He wants to give the miller's wheel especially low tax. 

The bandits are easily routed. 

Nasher says our job is the army, but that we aren't lords. Maude from the Silverthorns will open trade with us and send people who could sort out mining.

**Fortnight 3**

Galleon's phoenix hatches.  

Lord Valiss, Roe, and a normal 30-man guard. Also we've got some priests of Kelbrimor.

A "Speaker" of Kelbrimor felt a rift to the Shadowfell in this area. They want to station some people here.

Room has leather armor, spear, and shortsword in the underground room.
