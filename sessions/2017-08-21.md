We send to Kelgar\: it goes through but he gets no response. We then let Sir Kollum know about it. 

In the morning, we leave. Spend a night, and another, 

Greycloaks == royal army. Army did not have any representation from Eastweld (Roe) and Brodkurv (Valis)

We're reconsidering calling ourselves "The Conductors". Balthazar shared his visions of Gruumsh chaining him, other gods chaining him, etc. Vess shared her dream from the conductor, and 

"FOrget the betrayer and forget the escapee, we should recover what was lost and kill the Kalek-cha." As Dalrin, he was being tortured by the leader of the Gith (Zier Zawar Mec). 

(Calrin died in suspicious circumstances, and Dalrin's death followed and kicked off an investigation. Qwigon and ??? were ???)

Balthazar is having backpack troubles. It might have to do with the cultist stones we always pick up. They seem to now be acting under the influence of a divination spell. They work by walking into shadows with them and say the name of the person you want to talk to. Galleon starts to talk to the Conductor, and we can hear the whole thing.

Logrum betrayed both the Augur and Conductor. Conductor agents in the area haven't been performing and have been "recalled". Galleon suggests that the Conductor should let us share in the power if we join him. Logrum wasn't undead, and Conductor gloated a bit over decieving us. "Kelgar sends his regards."

If he has Kelgar, then he probably has Duncan and Chandra. Balthazar tries to contact his father with Sending and the stones activate again. Then Balthazar tries his father with the stone. BFather seems happy but a bit overwhelmed, and he seems happy to be fighting the Raven Queen (and her Gloaming Court) in the Shadowfell. BFather says he could take on the Gruumsh curse. 

We were stopped at a Roenel checkpoint, less than a day from Roenel (this is the fourth day). Dimirrodin tried to bribe them, not really knowingly. 

Chanel is the Roenel court mage. Super dark elven female (not drow). Roenel recieved words from "friends in the west that war would be on the horizon", war with "the undead". She says we're on the side of Hector and we come "highly recommended". 

Chanel is preparing the city to fight necromancers. She knows druidic... but is maybe also a wizard? She teleports us for the Staff of the Python + 300gp (+ free necrostone).

Elootra locates Kelgar's "Animating Force" in the Sword mountains. Isaac is in the Shadowfell somewhere vaguely south of Neverwinter. "We still haven't been able to solve the demonic activities of the Black Lake". Docks are a mess but are maybe just now calming down.

Port authority was attacked and only harbormaster survived (burned). He burned and killed any business that might be related to crime. King Nasher made a new harbor authority and jailed the harbormaster. New council lowered tariffs on things from Amn, which has made King Nasher a bit upset. 

Nothing really happened with the Black Lake. Archives are open once again, under heavy guard.

Duncan and Chandra are somewhere in the forest between Ember (to the north) and Crags.


Berlaina is pretty confused about why we tried to drop her name when at OOW. Sir Casavir is one of the two most notorious killers in Neverwinter. The harbormasters actions were popular with the guard. We don't clear up much of anything, but she seems overall okay with us.

Moira was there, Duke Annikin is not burned, and he says under magical compulsion to explain that they were trying to cause chaos. 


Natrissa is high priestess of Neverwinter Lethander. She says that if Balthazar dedicates a great work to Lethander, the way an aspiring Lethaderian paladin would, then Lethander might cure him. But it has to be done for Lethander's sake.

Sal the barman is behind the bar of the Sunken Flagon. Duncan isn't around. Duncan and Chandra went to Sand when they left. 

Sand says the two should be in "the old hideout/warehouse in the merchant district". Sand regularly leaves them food at a dead drop, and the food is always taken by the next day. 

Warehouse is Sand's Sanding Sandporium. We find gith in there.


(Qwigon is not dead, BFather is Isaac) (Brelaina is the captain of the guard in the city) Duke Annikin is the Harbormaster.
