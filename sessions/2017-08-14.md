(merchant left OOW on the eve of the battle, got there when we did, has a week-on/week-off, Simee shows up 5pm the day after we arrive at OOW)

Foreman thinks a miner may have stolen the “Stoutcorps key”, a family heirloom. (turns out it’s a maul)

Head out, another day, next day we capture a goblin, another day, another day at noon we arrive at OOW

Kollum and Asani seem to know eachother. Asani has a way of getting to Neverwinter by sunset. 

Oswin Kane says Nasher has him there for a specific reason and thanked us for what we’ve done.

Aliss has obviously dyed hair, called Kane “Grayson”, 

Spend the night, laze about until 5 the next day to meet Simi. Simi has contacts at the jewelry shop Mortimers in Neverwinter. Court wizard at Roenel could teleport us.

Harbormaster raising hell in docks, Nahser cracking down and things are almost pandemonium.
