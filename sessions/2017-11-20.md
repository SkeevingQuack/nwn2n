((I was gone for this))

Summary: decided not to fight the orcs. went into the chapel, found a room dedicated to each season. You could do a small meditation ritual and hear about people killed by the shadow king (only the one surviving season). We were given the opportunity to conquer our fears.

We need three elves and three dwarves to activate some statue.
