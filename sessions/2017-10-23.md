Torio Kleevan is ambassador from Luskan. She helped lie about Ember? 

Crossroad Keep and 20 mile radius is ours.

Valis abandoned the keep when it was sacked in the last war with the Shadow King and Neverwinter didn't help repair it.

Aliss is the one we meet with for this.

Some copses two miles to the east. 

Only Galleon knows about his itz-kazar tome. It has stuff about golems.

High Elf and a halfling show up at our feast. Looking for Kana. Kana might be Aliss's real name or is a friend? Kana is Kyarl Greymane's daughter (has grey hair). Ahliera wants a chunk of a big crystal in the east. Knows Deacon. 

East to a mountain, find a floating purple crystal in the mountains, chip off a bit of the crystal, we get information and Many-Starred Cloak, Aliss is freed, future business opportunities. 

Roenels tried to claim that a wedding pact happened between them and Kana, so she hid until they had the power to let her assume the Wardenship. 

Sir Oswin is Sir Frederick. Aliss wants to be called Aliss.

Amethyst dragons were a thing, but supposedly they died out. 

Nolaloth is the crystal dragon. Ahliera says they'll help us out. 

King of Shadows was the folly of Ilfarn. He is the reason for Nolaloth's "non-existence". He fought the King of Shadows at some point and just super lost. Our answers may lie in their holy city of Arvahn. 

Tyta had the location of Arvahn put into her head.
