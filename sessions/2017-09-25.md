## Session

Guards at front are Deorwin and Finn. Protecting Lord Taverick from probable demons. Melia is a very attractive lady flirting with Lord Taverick. Inside guards are Lt. Valeria (is a marksman) and Capt. Ballard.

"You're too late to save the girl." "We have the shard"

He's worried about his girlfriend and tells us to go help her at the Moonstone Mask. Upper floors of the Moonstone Mask are blown apart. Melia is dead, and she is from the Neverwinter Nine. 

Kira was a member of the Neverwinter Nine. Ballard didn't know. King Nasher knew about the plan. 

Murderer is Aman Jerrow, King of Shadows. Shandra's Gpa. 

Aman court wizard before and after Nasher's rise. He warned people about a coming apocalypse; spellplague, Aman wasn't affected. Aman was going to tele three and a knight contingent to some fort and then went off-book and tried to help ~; saw Aman ordering demons, also had shard. 

After two deaths, he told Nasher everything. 

Black Garius is leader of Arcane Brotherhood and de facto leader of Luskan. He is at Crossroad Keep. Notes said BG (black Garius) and crossroad keep (CK). It can be a declaration of war, though he'd prefer the keep standing at the end in order to be a base of operations in the south. Also find the Tome of Ilt Kazaar. Powerful relic/book created by archmages of ilfarn. Most believe BG used it to rise to power. Mainly it's golemcrafting and portals and esotera

Maybe look for thalantir.
