We found dead bodies sucked dry of blood, as if by a vampire.

We're partially in the Shadowfell again.

As we interrupt the ritual the four corner ritualist erupt into ruby red, violet, green, and orange, and the middle guy is in blue flames. The corners burn to death. Black goo pours out of middle man's face holes. 

We begin moving back to the prime material, Conductor starts talking. Says that Black Garius was going to try to usurp the King of Shadows, but the Conductor messed with it so that he would instead just become an avatar. 

Aftermath

Sir Nebal and a weaselly man invite us to a war meeting. Dude is master artisan Vitel, and Nebal offers to let us helm the renovation of the keep with provisional council titles (military governor?). 70,000gp budget to reconstruct keep.

2 goals: see to the keep and make it ready, and discover anything to fight the King of Shadows.
