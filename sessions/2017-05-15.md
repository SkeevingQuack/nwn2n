Some wizard wants an escort in order to close bits of the big gash. 

Nasher thinks something big is going on at OOW. Orc tribes rallied around Maurgrum, which was weird. They’re allying again, so maybe there’s a new orc cult leader. 

Wizard is Thalantir? 

Wizard Tower is in “mountains”, and he spent essentially all his time in Neverwinter. 

Elootra likes the Roysons. She teleported us directly into the feasting hall. Eliwood is the lord.

Eliwood knows the Archive, is incredibly troubled by the central chamber being raided.

Group of merchants passing through that avoided the castles, 4 days ago. Were heading east, then turned south. Might be on the road but they’re maybe in the argent peaks which wouldn’t be Royson land.

Highcliff lords are helping Nashar

The slavers were taking an erratic route through their lands, but have crossed into Argent Peaks.

Eliwood  might be sick? Or maybe just old.

Only family in Argent Peaks is Sverdson, rule from Phandalin. Close allies with Vallis. Hector doesn’t like Vallis (or Sverdson). 

3 days? I need to ask to make sure, I think there was another day.

Tried a town, general goods merchant said there were three closed wagons heading into the mountains to meet the Jeffersons. They passed through yesterday. 

Jeffersons are silver merchants, supposedly have mithril as well. Valiss are “true sons of the south”

Cave has crazy black-glow sigils on the walls, and this particular order of necromancers is sacrificing people.
