First day of the new year

Started in West Harbor. Everyone from it. Suddenly attacked by duergar. Fended off the attack. Dagan(uncle) gave them stone, said it was probs super important to get it to Duncan. He is now Kalak’cha. 

Go to aldenon the sage. He definitely found the shards interesting. Has his own shard. Believes shards are from Githyanki silver sword. Githyanki are “magical space pirates”. Silver swords are their most treasured possessions, modeled after the sword of Gith when she freed them from the mind flayers. Gith-zarai wanted to just be peaceful, Gith-yanki enslaved people to build up an army. Collar looks like a thrall collar. 

Githyanki led by lich queen. Probably will pursue Kalak-cha until death, regardless of if they get the shards back. Alman jerrow (old court wizard) has one and can “sever an astral tether”. MIght get more info from his kin. Aldenon bought his shard off a merchant after the “long night ended”. Kalak-cha seems like more of a title than just a bearer of these shards. 

One murder victim was in war with Luskan and Long Night; no signs of foul play and yet Many-Starred Cloaks are certain. Other victim was also in the Long Night. Lord Kaldrinn and Lord Qwigon are nobility in the Black Lake that served during the War of Shadows and are still alive. 

Dimirriden feels weird/good when he touches it, has super old scar over heart, may have been with the sword from which those shards come, has no scar on back. Galleon is part of many-starred cloaks, is working on the case. 

Galleon was apparently a traveler (Duncan’s inn is sunken flagon). Day passes, we all head to cloak tower.

Elootra is guildmistress, already seems to know Balthazar. Vess made a promise to tell all she knows of the investigation to agents of Neverwinter while in a zone of truth, we were given bracers to show we’re part of the investigation. Lingering eldritch aura around mansions (dalrin & whoever). Servants were around for Qwigon, unaffected. Murders occurred 4 weeks and 1 week ago. 

(king of shadow war had been suddenly defeated at West Harbor. Don’t know if I know this. Only four people had survived on Neverwinter’s side)

Greeter is missing from reception in Archive. Galleon has hawk named feathers? 10 old, dead bodies found in right side room of archives. Archivists wear magical veils that “blind them to the arcane but get some specific true-seeing”. 

People being magically controlled start attacking, including an archivist. Main vault door was untouched, but we shrunk the door off. Grand arcanist dead, has eyes cut out. Everything in the vault was trashed and strewn about. 

Alman Jerow was leader of the Many-Starred Cloak before court wizard. Alman had wife and daughter. Granddaughter is Chandra, living in highcliff; this name is clearly marked. Chandra Jerrow was the lady with the farm we sorta saved. Sending reveals she is being attacked by monsters, we and Alutra are teleportaion circling.

Deacon is crazy Kobold
