Elootra is apparently poisoned and is unconcious. Shandra is freaked out because she seems to know nothing about this and wants nothing to do with it. Shandra currently has my hide armor.

Sent an animal messenger to Dawnbringer Derrin, lizardfolk definitely seem to have integrated healthily with Highcliff. Elootra was struck with a terrible poison, but Derrin managed to cure it. 

Shandra didn’t recognize the shards, but eventually she figured out that maybe it has something to do with her family’s wizard tower. She freaks out about how we only want her to access the tower, and Galleon tries to use Suggestion on her. She saves, runs away and screams about how we’re attacking her. Balthazar tackles Galleon, eventually Derrin comes in and gets pissed at us, Galleon owns up and Dimirrodin sorta takes his side and says he’s part of our “party”, leads Shandra away.

Spend night at snooty noble inn. 

We find Shandra with an awake Elootra, and she explains that the Wizard Tower of $courtwizard probably has all his stuff and that it can only be opened by “spilling Jerrow blood”. Shandra decides she doesn’t want to endanger Highcliff by staying in it, and the whole group teleports to Neverwinter without telling Derrin. 

Balthazar is looking into slavery; it seems people are disappearing in Neverwinter (possibly throughout Neverwinter); some blame the chasm. Dock gang attacked the Harbor Authority last night, only one left alive is the Harbormaster.
