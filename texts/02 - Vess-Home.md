# Sealed letter addressed to Bilyana Tchurminska in Silverymoon, sent via raven

Vess would know and use the proper forms of address, in case I messed up somewhere. Written in Damaran

*To my dear family,*

*As you may know, lizardfolk have been waging war against the populace of southern Neverwinter. I was recently in a position to hear the lizardling chief explain their motivations and found myself sympathetic, though unconvinced that their actions were just. Apparently their young have been mysteriously dying, so they moved north in hopes that this plague would stop. History shows that any attempt by lizardfolk to live peacefully near humans will always end in slaughter as the humans claim more and more land, so the lizardling chief simply decided to skip that step and drive the humans out first.*

*I accompanied the chief to the initial peace talks with the Southern Lords, only bothering to hope that neither party would attack the other during the negotiations. However, Lord Royson's son and proxy Lord Hector stepped forward and offered them near-autonomy on a portion of his land in exchange for military aid against any mutual enemies. He said that any true follower of Tyr would know this is the right course of action, and even pushed past his severe discomfort when the chief asked him to secure the deal in what seems to be a traditional lizardfolk way.*

*I cannot attend the more formal treaty negotiations, nor do I expect to stay long enough to determine whether this treaty is observed in earnest by all peoples. All I can say is that in my limited knowledge of Lord Hector Royson, he seems to be a righteous, intelligent man, willing to go against the grain to do what he believes is necessary.*

*With love,*

*Vesna Tchurminska*

Inside is another sealed letter, this one addressed to Miro

*I am, as always and despite your assurances, sorry I don’t write more. That may change soon, though, as it seems I’m caught up in something important and mysterious and keeping someone else up to date would be a good idea. However I would have to find a more secure means, and I’m plumb out of ideas on that front. Despite my powerful Pagan Magicks, I’ve now met a minstrel who does instantly things that the elders only manage to do slowly and awkwardly.*

*...I think I might actually be a bit jealous. I never asked for this, but over the last few years I’ve grown accustomed to being more talented than anyone within decades of my age; now I’ve met someone at least my equal who could very well be several years my junior. It makes me wish I had paid more attention when you’d read your books to me. I don’t have the drive to learn what you did (and him as well, likely), but it seems I could use a better understanding of magic. For many reasons, these days.*

*Perhaps jealousy isn’t the word. I certainly bear him no ill will, and I trust him in a crisis more than I’d ever trust the half-orc or the berserker. But I can’t trust them and I am for all intents and purposes alone and this unassuming minstrel can have a conversation with a random acquaintance halfway around the world whereas I’ll probably have participated in five more wars before I hear back from you.*

*I ramble. Suffice it to say I’m travelling with a group in order to spy on them, and while they probably aren’t responsible for it they are definitely wrapped up in some major shit.*

*Let everyone know that I love them, and didn’t mean to snub them but I don’t have the energy right now to write a real letter to more than just you. As for Roysonson, you know I’ve always been good at judging people. That only improved with my years as a deplorable savage, and I mean sincerely what I say about him. I trust the twins can figure everything out from there, if they have any plans for southern Neverwinter. Politics here currently seem very dicey, but it’s beyond me whether that’s an opportunity or a danger.*
