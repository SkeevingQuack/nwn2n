# Texts

Letters between characters, notes, or other writing.

I'm also including special dreams, but I guess maybe I won't if I decide that Vess shouldn't remember them perfectly.

### Notes

I want Vess to write in British English, but I've never really done that. [This list](http://www.tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html) might be helpful if I can make a filter out of it.
