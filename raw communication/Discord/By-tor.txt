She doesn't mind the thought of dying, she doesn't care what most people think about her, and she doesn't believe the King of Shadows would be able to take over the world even if she fails to stop him from taking Neverwinter. So while she rarely dwells on this, I'd say it is her biggest worry and it acts as her prime motivating factor:\n\nSince Vess was a child, she has feared that her parents and family would stop accepting her behavior and they'd write her off as a worthless, spoiled brat who failed them. In fact, she doesn't understand why her family *doesn't* think of her this way. When Vess first became a druid she was excited to show her family that there was something concrete that she had accomplished, but in the end she just gained a bunch of powers that she still didn't use for anything substantial.

She has seen more than a handful of orcs and half-orcs lose their temper and enjoy the ensuing violence, but that has never scared her the same way. She can understand the excitement of physical exertion and competition and battle, and she has seen the look on many a face when the high ends and they realize what they've done. But she doesn't understand the pure malevolence of the drow, and they're too good at acting for her to take anything they say at face-value.\n\nThis isn't something that she acknowledges about herself. She's very proud of Silverymoon's acceptance of all races and focus on the individual, and she's disgusted by racism, especially from people with little experience with that race. She believes that anyone can overcome the inclinations of their heritage, but she doesn't realize that that belief is a lot more fragile when it comes to the drow.
