| Feb 13, 2017 15:59:49 | Mitchell Budde | If you don't mind my asking how busy are you most Monday afternoons? |
| Feb 13, 2017 16:10:21 | Mitchell Budde | For context someone had to leave Neverwinter Nights and we're looking to fill the spot if you would be interested. |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:20:38 | Brad | Sounds good. You can facebook me any links I'll need. And I forgot to ask, but if Lynnay is free tomorrow I was going to drop by to go over computer stuff, so if it works out we could talk DnD |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:23:57 | Mitchell Budde | So much stuff to send. Depends what time. I have an interview at 8am.  |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:26:16 | Brad | Would noon work? |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:26:47 | Mitchell Budde | It should! |
| Feb 14, 2017 12:05:48 | Brad | Here |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:37:07 | Brad | What peples live around Neverwinter or farther north? |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:41:33 | Mitchell Budde | The city itself is one of the most cosmopolitan on the continent boast a rather diverse population demografic. To the north there are the Uthgard tribes (some of which have 'civilized' since unification) which are humans and half-orcs and to the south are largely human lands but a good amount of dwarves and respectable population of elves. Way north is the port town of Luskan which is made up of Illuskan (a human sub group) raiders and the arcane brotherhood which accepts any members (though it is an evil organization). |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:48:55 | Brad | Do the druids in Faerun have any sort of society, hierarchy, or politics? |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:51:19 | Mitchell Budde | Different circle have different rules. The druids in Neverwinter usually belong to the Circle of the Sword and there is a hierarchy of elders who make decisions that druids carry out with an Archdruid at the head. |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:09:39 | Brad | 13,13,13,15,15,16
Everything within 4 of eachother, and five of them were odd. |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:10:12 | Mitchell Budde | Haha very nice. You going druid? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:10:49 | Brad | Yep, Human circle of the moon (mechanically) |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:14:56 | Mitchell Budde | Unless you're a particularly social druid this probably hasn't been a huge deal but most people wouldn't differentiate between your magic and arcane so you know to be careful with who knows of your abilities. @ |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:16:18 | Brad | Ah, interesting. That changes some minor things. So clerics probably only avoid suspicion by being very obviously godly? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:17:29 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. Holy symbols and all. Some crafter caster masquerade using divine symbols as casting foci. This is incredibly dangerous as it is seen as heretical by all but gods of magic.  |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:18:03 | Mitchell Budde | Crafty casters* |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:21:27 | Brad | Would being very ostensibly devoted to a nature deity give me the best of both worlds? I'd seem like a cleric to the ignorant, but the informed wouldn't consider it blaspheming? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:24:03 | Mitchell Budde | That would probably fly for everyone but people who hate that God (which shouldn't be a ton) Many will see you as an ignorant savage to an extent though (unless that doesn't quite mesh with what you want). |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:26:12 | Brad | I think I'd prefer it.  |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:27:26 | Mitchell Budde | Perfect. I was going to start you in Highcliffe so if there's any roll playing you need to do let me know or include it in your backstory. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:21:21 | Mitchell Budde | The druid circle plays a role in this plot so some things to consider (and if this doesn't work with what you had in mind we can work to make it fit): the Circle of swords has become very insular since the Spellplague and has broken off into two "factions". To the south is the Circle of the Mere which tends to lands of the Mere of Dead Men and to the north is the Circle of the Wood which keeps to the Neverwinter Woods. They say the spit was due to a schism between the two highest ranking druids after the death of the last Arch Druid during the Luskan War. Elder Vashne left with a small cadre of druids and went into exile in the swamp while Elder Naevan kept a more traditional touch within the Neverwinter wood. No new arch druid has been named. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:22:50 | Brad | The factions don't claim their own elder is Archdruid? |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:23:23 | Mitchell Budde | Kaiser, Volsung, KÃ¶hler, Hapsburg for names. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:24:35 | Mitchell Budde | As far as you can tell neither wants to take that step as it would mean the other circle was truly lost to them. Most members hope the Circle can be restored. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:28:37 | Mitchell Budde | As to their beliefs Vashne thinks the druids should allow the lands to change and they should change to mirror the lands. Naevan takes a traditional approach as trying to keep everything preserved as is.  |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:31:32 | Brad | What sort of change? Do they allow forests to be cut down for lumber and farmland, or do you mean the more godly, apocalyptic changes? |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:41:44 | Mitchell Budde | It's kept somewhat vague buy Vashne explains that he chose the Mere as his home because it's the perfect example of what he means. It used to be a small swamp region but there was a terrible battle between orcs dwarves and elves that took place there. Such was the carnage to the land that the swamp grew and gained it's new name. He wants druids to emulate that kind of change. Take that as you will. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:45:15 | Brad | Compared to the present, when was the end of the spellplague and when was the Archdruid's death?  |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:49:48 | Mitchell Budde | I'm at ASI so I don't have my timeline but Spellplague ended roughly 16 years ago and the Archdruid died 19-20 years ago. |
| Feb 16, 2017 18:18:37 | Mitchell Budde | I was off by quite a bit. Archdruid died 30 years ago, and Spellplague ended 7 years ago. |
| Feb 16, 2017 19:00:28 | Brad | For people not directly related to the arcane, was the end of the spellplague important? Was life during the spellplague more dangerous or anything? |
| Feb 16, 2017 19:03:14 | Mitchell Budde | In some places there were devestating natural disasters and many kingdoms were thrown into chaos following the loss of magic networks but for the average Joe farmer not really. |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:18:02 | Mitchell Budde | One more thing about the druid though they have split they do meet once a year during a time sacred to Silvanus so you have a passing familiarity with the whole Circle of Swords.  You know for the past few years crops have been failing near the Mere though why is unknown. A possible hook for you is you may have run into the Mere druid Elanee who believes that a traveling group may be involved somehow in all this (she doesn't blame them though). |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:21:50 | Brad | Would that be a time when people mingle and can share ideas and philosophy, or is it mainly pomp and tradition and trying to poach others to your circle is frowned upon? |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:23:03 | Mitchell Budde | More of the former. There are important rituals that need to be performed to keep the forest of Neverwinter healthy as well |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:27:20 | Mitchell Budde | If you do take the Elanee route let me know because she would share some details with you. |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:32:07 | Brad | I definitely will take that route. I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with Vess having talked with druids from the Mere. I think things will work smoother if she isn't a part of the circle, but I need more info about their views before I can justify that. Might require roleplay.  |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:32:25 | Brad | Have you looked into free copies of tabletop simulator? |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:38:07 | Mitchell Budde | Sorry they were out. But If you want I will gift you a copy. Elanee recently made contact with the group but they turned down her offer of aid. She tells you that she was assigned the region of the Mere that West Harbor sits upon. She was too late to help but she saw the aftermath of a slaughter there and this group leaving the village with a powerful magical artifact of some sort. They've been consistently attacked by outsiders since leaving. She thinks this magic item is tied to the spreading blight from the mere. She's been worried that you're the first druid she's seen since the last yearly meeting and she's going to search for Elder Vashne or any other members of her circle |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:15:38 | Brad | Does she have a description of the group and the artifact? |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:44:54 | Mitchell Budde | The artifact had to be small because they kept it wrapped in a silk bundle. The one carrying the shard was a half-orc tall and thin for his kind. He wore a chain shirt or mithril and could be quite abrasive. There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort and used a bow. He seemed more naive and a bit meek. The final member was a dwarf female who wore no armor and used a specialized axe in combat. She bore many scars and took a strong disliking to Elanee though she knew not why. @ |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:53:28 | Brad | Elanee didn't know why, right?
And when you say she was assigned this portion of the mere, you mean that she was told to investigate that area? How long ago was she instructed to do that? |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:55:51 | Mitchell Budde | No she's been tending to the life in that area for many years. Since the schism. |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:04:04 | Brad | So Elashnee only took an interest in them after seeing them leave the village? Does she have any evidence that they aren't involved, or is she just going off of gut? Does she seem like the naive, trusting type? |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:14:23 | Mitchell Budde | Correct. Going off gut. Depends on how shallow your character is. Based on her looks she seems to be a very young elf, but she doesn't seem to have that air of naivete about her. Even if they aren't involved directly with the growing blight  the presence of outsiders is worry some. |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:19:49 | Brad | Do you have a plan for introducing me? |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:23:05 | Mitchell Budde | I can force it if need be easily enough but I'll try and make and set the scene so you're all in Highcliffe together. |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:46:41 | Brad | "There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort"
As in bard magic? I just noticed this and don't know whether you accidentally gave me extra info.  |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:47:50 | Mitchell Budde | Bard is a general term in Faerun. It was more that he had access to magical power. |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:48:57 | Brad | Gotcha.  |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:00:16 | Mitchell Budde | Can I get your Skype info? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:00:43 | Brad | Brad.aylsworth@gmail.com |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:01:00 | Brad | I think |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:02:10 | Mitchell Budde | Contact request sent |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:04:54 | Mitchell Budde | Also my server is BuddeCorner and the password is Jakeisanerd  |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:25:19 | Mitchell Budde | You are listening in on this. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:29:29 | Mitchell Budde | What will you be doing now? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:29:44 | Brad | I'm following Balthazar and Dimirrodin. As a cat |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:31:38 | Mitchell Budde | Stealth check please. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:31:59 | Brad | Use the ingame one? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:32:16 | Mitchell Budde | Up to you. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:35:27 | Mitchell Budde | You hear this |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:37:22 | Mitchell Budde | Any response |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:50:25 | Mitchell Budde | Start to follow again? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:55:47 | Mitchell Budde | You are told that the roads are dangerous and that a ship would be the safest route barring the lizard folk. He just met a adherent of Neverwinter heading in that direction you could maybe travel with.@ |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:57:57 | Brad | I'm not confident about the safety of ship travel, so that Neverwinter person  sounds perfect. If he could get me into contact with them it'd be deeply appreciated. |
| Feb 20, 2017 18:00:35 | Mitchell Budde | He will send a runner. |
| Feb 20, 2017 18:09:37 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Feb 20, 2017 21:55:11 | Brad | I want to see if I can place the name "Kelgor". 13 Religion, 14 History |
| Feb 20, 2017 21:55:47 | Mitchell Budde | You cannot.  |
| Feb 21, 2017 15:10:31 | Brad | Did Elanee really only see the three of them, not four? |
| Feb 21, 2017 15:11:15 | Mitchell Budde | She saw a fourth when they left but he then left the group and there were only 3 when she met them
 |
| Feb 27, 2017 21:19:22 | Brad | Outside the city I'm going to dig up a cache of my belongings, and then send one Animal Messenger to Elanee and one to my family. |
| Feb 27, 2017 21:19:55 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Mar 6, 2017 17:29:39 | Brad | Sorry, one minute |
| Mar 6, 2017 17:37:06 | Brad | ...nevermind, missed that text |
| Mar 13, 2017 13:03:07 | Brad | Do you want fighter? The more I think about what Jake's session will be like, the less I care if my character will have an interesting personality. I'd happily switch. |
| Mar 13, 2017 13:03:48 | Mitchell Budde | Nah it's all good. I have warlock... plans now.  |
| Mar 14, 2017 11:52:46 | Brad | Mind if I drop by in about half an hour? |
| Mar 14, 2017 11:53:28 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all |
| Mar 14, 2017 12:34:37 | Brad | Here |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:07:15 | Mitchell Budde | If you wanted to play as diggity that would be fine. Or if they just want to do it with two players. Whatever works for you 3. |
| Apr 2, 2017 17:59:55 | Brad | Amara knows that those stained glass windows depicted many components related to necromancy |
| Apr 2, 2017 18:00:19 | Mitchell Budde | Oh good.  |
| Apr 2, 2017 18:56:06 | Brad | It seems like the creatures are being drawn into the box depicted on their windows, faces filled with fear. At first glance it had seemed they were being conjured out of it. |
| Apr 5, 2017 19:30:55 | Mitchell Budde | Any mornings coming up you'd be free for persona? |
| Apr 5, 2017 22:03:38 | Brad | Maybe Friday or Saturday. Some schoolwork came up, sadly. |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:01:36 | Brad | I forgot that Saturday is a weekend and the bus schedule gets weird. So if I don't hear from you, I'll just do the buses and I'll arrive around 8:40. Or, if you let me know, you can just come pick me up whenever.

Because you have a car and Persona 5 is more important than my own feelings of independence. |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:06:04 | Mitchell Budde | Let me shower and I will come get you.  |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:49:25 | Mitchell Budde | Outside |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:54:44 | Brad | Amara keeps a journal, yes?  |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:55:22 | Mitchell Budde | Yup. |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:59:59 | Brad | You recognize those notes as pages from your journal. You have no idea how or when he managed to get them, but when you check you indeed see some missing pages.

The rest of the trash was the other things you knew he took, and even some chicken bones you have a sneaking suspicion originated from your meals.  |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:03:45 | Mitchell Budde | Gross. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:06:22 | Brad | Does Tyall know Amara's old stance on necromancy? |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:12 | Brad | Also, does Aljaan know? I'm not sure how meaningful Josh's comment is. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:17 | Mitchell Budde | He knows she hates it and would never use it but not why. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:08:50 | Mitchell Budde | Amara has said that she hates it in game, but never elaborated much. |
| Apr 10, 2017 08:08:34 | Mitchell Budde | Outside |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:03:43 | Brad | You up for Persona Saturday morning? |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:04:19 | Mitchell Budde | Heck yeah! |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:06:00 | Brad | I'll look into getting there around 8, but I need to make sure my bike is up to it. |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:08:48 | Mitchell Budde | Ok sweet! |
| Apr 22, 2017 07:41:29 | Brad | I'll be there around 8:40. |
| Apr 22, 2017 07:41:52 | Mitchell Budde | Ok! |
| Apr 22, 2017 08:47:02 | Brad | In the back |
| Apr 30, 2017 08:36:44 | Brad | So I sat down to flesh out Vess's Neverwinter ally a little, and instead spent several hours writing out an overview of the last four generations of Vess's family. |
| Apr 30, 2017 08:41:20 | Mitchell Budde | Classic Brad.  |
| Apr 30, 2017 17:37:58 | Brad | More dreams about murdering your mom. If this bothers you, you have so much trouble you can't sleep much and you take a point of exhaustion. |
| May 1, 2017 07:56:02 | Brad | ETA 8:30 |
| May 1, 2017 08:35:26 | Brad | Back door |
| May 1, 2017 15:42:15 | Mitchell Budde | Fuck insta death spells. |
| May 1, 2017 16:07:01 | Brad | Does this game have any sort of homunculus item? |
| May 1, 2017 16:07:37 | Brad | I may have to review my decision on golems. I found the Manual of Golems in the DMG  |
| May 1, 2017 16:25:24 | Mitchell Budde | That's fine.  |
| May 1, 2017 16:37:16 | Brad | Oh, I forgot to bring up that I'm wondering if I can alter the long rest rules to fit my character better. Something like she doesn't have to get consecutive hours of sleep for them to count, but she requires 10 hours for a long rest and sleep she gets somewhere weird only counts half time. She'd still prepare spells when everyone else would, because otherwise that would be chaos. |
| May 1, 2017 16:38:06 | Mitchell Budde | I'm ok with that. |
| May 8, 2017 20:30:55 | Mitchell Budde | Find Brother Dehlila she will find you a new room. |
| Jun 13, 2017 08:52:04 | Brad | Any chance you've got a spare flash drive we could use for Persona 5? |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:21:17 | Mitchell Budde | Absolutely. |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:32:35 | Brad | Are either of you going to be downtown/campus this afternoon? |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:36:10 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay will be at the corner W from 4 to midnight.  |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:40:42 | Brad | Sweet. If you could get the files onto a flash drive, I'll stop by the corner W a little after 4. |
| Jun 13, 2017 11:14:51 | Mitchell Budde | Done. |
| Jul 3, 2017 13:30:48 | Brad | What company made your dice? |
| Jul 3, 2017 13:58:41 | Mitchell Budde | Easy Roller.  |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:37:28 | Brad | Do you just have Discord on your laptop? |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:37:45 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:38:28 | Brad | Do you have a one-shot character yet, or do you need any info from me for it? |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:39:28 | Mitchell Budde | Since Lynnay was doing a spoof character I was going to make a pink haired anime protagonist who is despretly trying to avoid her fate.  |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:46:02 | Brad | I can work with that? 
And I think if you two gender swap a third time, I'm just going to assume it's your kink. |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:47:20 | Mitchell Budde | Oh I'm sorry I'm not playing into your heteronormative worldview Braaaad.   |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:16:43 | Brad | Did anyone end up going above 20? |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:16:43 | Brad | Did anyone end up going above 20? |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:17:26 | Mitchell Budde | No. |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:14:04 | Brad | ? |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:14:50 | Mitchell Budde | Those are apparently your sunglasses that are now in my possesion.  |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:16:16 | Brad | I don't remember ever wearing those. But I'll take 'em. |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:18:57 | Mitchell Budde | He swears they are yours.  |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:21:12 | Brad | Jake? Ah, you know, those might be mine, then. I don't know why they don't look right, but if I saw them in person I probably would. Thanks |
| Aug 21, 2016 18:16:26 | Brad | Attachment: application/smil, Attachment: image/jpeg |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:50:19 | Brad | Attachment: image/jpeg, the size of a normal toblerone, because I swear you tried to convince me the one on your table is normal. |
| Feb 16, 2017 00:03:57 | Someone else | Attachment: image/jpeg, I don't know what you're talking about.  |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:12:38 | Someone else | Attachment: image/jpeg, Anime protagonist stats: accomplished  |

| Feb 19, 2017 14:58:39 | Someone else | Hey everyone this will be the new text chat for Neverwinter Nights with new addition Brad (he's pretty ok I guess). I was going to wait til after role playing but why doesn't everyone level up to 5 before tomorrow. That way we don't do it mid session. Lizardfolk and who knows what else awaits you in the next leg of your journey! |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:06:45 | Someone else | Welcome bradical. What you playin? |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:06:58 | Someone else | Dwarf monk, with missing teeth? |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:08:39 | Brad | Close. I have all my teeth, but they're on my forearm instead of in my mouth.
Horrible accident. Don't like to talk about it. |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:14:28 | Someone else | That's.. thats... devastating. |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:20:29 | Someone else | I start mason city next Thursday  |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:21:19 | Someone else | Alright. Thank you for the heads up! |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:35:52 | Someone else | I am free this Monday, but will busy future Mondays for a few weeks |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:36:09 | Someone else | Ok. |
| Feb 22, 2017 11:50:26 | Someone else | Dope. |
| Feb 27, 2017 11:57:32 | Someone else | Everyone free for tonight? |
| Feb 27, 2017 11:57:55 | Brad | Yep |

| Feb 27, 2017 12:58:51 | Someone else | Der Ritter are the finest riders in the kingdom ;) |
| Mar 6, 2017 09:30:20 | Someone else | Hey guys feel free to make your characters before we play today. 4d6 reroll ones. I care little about backstory and what not since this is a few sessions maximum. Background on the world: its 97% covered in water, and storms are crazy. You'll be on land the entirety of the game so you....shouldn't drown? The world is pretty unexplored. The major kingdom is the klessa empire, a large island chain. And rumors of another kingdom far SE have been heard.  |
| Mar 6, 2017 14:55:40 | Someone else | Bit of bad news someone called in sick to ASI tonight so I will be going to work. Feel free to play without me! |

| Mar 13, 2017 12:44:58 | Someone else | She also picked the hermit background. So while she is charismatic she's still patsy |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:45:31 | Someone else | Just a regular traveler. |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:49:05 | Someone else | Budde is a frog barbarian. I decided to let him to it, cuz I think it's a cool idea. |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:53:44 | Someone else | Jk budde is a warlock and brad is a fighter  |
| Mar 13, 2017 14:34:56 | Brad | Perfect HP rolls and normal class equipment? |

| Mar 17, 2017 12:30:41 | Someone else | They are short staffed on Mondays still :( |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:41:16 | Someone else | Lol |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:45:03 | Someone else | It just gives me more time to plot your party's demise mwhahaha.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:47:28 | Someone else | Is it really that difficult of thing to plot? The only one really difficult to kill will be patsy.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:47:50 | Someone else | And you can just hit her with like 15scorching rays  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:48:56 | Someone else | I don't know Jake, will you let me get into combat before you crit 16 times on a suprise round? |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:49:10 | Someone else | Don't give him any ideas! I want to be queen on the land |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:49:17 | Someone else | Probably not... EMOJI KA |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:50:16 | Someone else | To bad I've trapped you all on a boat. The King in Yellow loves cameos ;) |

| Mar 17, 2017 15:51:09 | Someone else | And let's be honest Balthazar can't swim.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 16:08:45 | Someone else | Well* Yet* |
| Mar 20, 2017 09:22:31 | Someone else | So guys (minus pope) we'll be continuing our magical mystery island campaign today then? I forget if I had you level up but feel free to do so. We will be lvl 4 |
| Mar 20, 2017 14:23:39 | Someone else | Sorry group Lynnay and I are trying to get a bunch of stuff sorted before we leave for the week and this is the only day we both will be home before Wednesday to get it done. Diggity will have to sit tonight out. |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:05:42 | Brad | So we should just skip it? |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:07:10 | Someone else |  Yeah we'll just continue it another time, when/pope can't do it sometime. |
| Mar 24, 2017 11:27:46 | Someone else | Is this Monday a thing guys? I'll still be at my hotel but I have internet? |
| Mar 24, 2017 11:28:46 | Someone else | I think budde is out of town this week |
| Mar 24, 2017 12:38:22 | Someone else |  It's been a particularly dnd-less few weeks. :( |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:45:32 | Someone else | Well well well Adventures I hope you've enjoyed your (well deserved) rest but once again trouble stirs. You may have uncovered the Esoteric Order of Dagon's machinations in Innsmouth but Grand Warlock Wilhelm Ryan escaped and now his dread gaze has settled elsewhere. Only you stand against the Eldritch Horrors but to do so you may have to stare into the Abyss.... if you dare.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:00 | Someone else | What in the world? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:45 | Someone else | Whwut |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:47 | Someone else | Don't tell me you forgot how you saved the coast from the deep ones? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:48:41 | Someone else | Did Cthulhu take over farun  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:49:04 | Someone else | No, I just would rather hear a romance for once.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:49:59 | Someone else | Sorry that was my bad. We'll pick up deep in the forests of Sein. You've recovered the element of air stolen by the twisted spirit Kuro but still must reclaim fire and water to restore the forest from the darkness that has blanketed it.   |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:31 | Someone else | I am so confused |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:52 | Someone else | I'll Call aedren the last airbender. Hes got a knack for that stuff  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:56 | Someone else | A romance?? Perhaps between alassi and kelgarh? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:51:19 | Someone else | Liked âA romance?? Perhaps between alassi and kelgarh?â |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:53:48 | Someone else | Dang it I don't know how I keep screwing this up. You've recovered the lost gem of Phandelver and we're enjoying the hospitality of the Fire Giant Bar and Grill but unfortunately a new guild othiwves has taken notice. Be careful as you navigate the various factions vying for dominance within the ciry. |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:54:05 | Someone else | Guild of thieves * |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:00:25 | Someone else | Too many campaigns... raz'll jump into your room with a mysterious rod and remind which campaign we're playing  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:00:58 | Someone else | also I did it wrong too. Arden, not aedren  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:03:25 | Someone else | I'm working towards an enormous Convergence arc to wrap up all campaigns.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:07:16 | Someone else | Sounds fun.... if you need additional campaigns, we could have a chat. I can fill you in on some characters of patsy and pope you could incorporate  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:13:36 | Someone else | Haha maybe down the road. For now I was just having a good old fashioned goof with ya'll |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:15:26 | Someone else | Oh you got me.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:21:29 | Someone else | You didn't get me! I'm too smart!.......ahaha..haha..ha |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:25:31 | Someone else | Obviously I would never be able to trick you Patsy.  |
| Apr 3, 2017 06:28:45 | Someone else | So we are playing today right? |
| Apr 3, 2017 09:32:18 | Someone else | That's the plan! |

| Apr 3, 2017 16:40:50 | Brad | Tabletop Sim also seems to support voice chat. |

| Apr 9, 2017 21:04:05 | Someone else | Wrong chat homie |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:04:16 | Brad | ...sorry |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:21 | Someone else | I'm cool with melding campaigns? |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:08:17 | Brad | The Lost Coast is so clearly a ripoff of the Sword Coast
 I don't even think melding them would be too difficult. |
| Apr 10, 2017 17:25:48 | Someone else | Make sure to sign up with the discord  link Brad sent.  |

Sorry if this is a bit late but I just want to confirm that everyone is a go for Monday, and to let you know I'll be sending out the loot you collected from last week. There's a lot if open threads and all of Neverwinter is open to you so if I had one request is to really think about what you want to do. |
| Apr 29, 2017 15:29:59 | Someone else | I will be there  |
| Apr 29, 2017 16:59:46 | Someone else | Same |

| Apr 29, 2017 17:24:38 | Someone else | C,
Things are proceeding smoothly. The Zhents have finally taken the hint and backed off with a little encouragement from A. The Luskan and local gangs are also losing ground, or falling in with us. Payment with the Unweavers has gone through, expect them before noon. Iâll be on the roofs with my handpicked so if things get unruly Iâll be there to save your skin. Again. Iâm most interested in what this group of mercenaries is after. If we can turn them from the guard, and their reputation isnât too overly exaggerated, we have all the pieces we need make our move. Honestly, I donât know why A wonât let us make the move now. The royal army is tied up at the Old Owl Well, the southern lords wonât lift a finger for Nasher, and the city guard are a joke. I think itâs time we take the initiative on the matter. If we get the results for what Benefactor is after A wonât be able to keep us out of the inner circle anymore. Think on it C. 
M |
| Apr 29, 2017 17:25:01 | Someone else | C,
Derrick has killed another citizen and two guards on his last shakedown, time to cut him loose. Permanently. Iâve made it clear we will not accomplish anything by drowning the docks in blood. I agree with your assessment on M, they are becoming far too aggressive and drawing too much attention to the situation. Nasherâs gaze may be on the south but the harbor is the last card he has to play and wonât give it up as easily as M presumes. We may have to move forward with Contingency as we discussed. Cut a deal with the mercs if you can, if they persist allow them to take you. Benefactor is watching the situation closely.

| May 1, 2017 14:41:28 | Someone else | I don't know if I would use the word "important" ;) |
| May 1, 2017 15:02:12 | Someone else | I just read this again. Shit, I didn't know we were that important. Also we don't reason with criminals. It's time "the Enforcers" took back the docks! |
| May 1, 2017 15:20:05 | Someone else | We are about to be. Or else it's their problem  |
| May 1, 2017 16:55:21 | Someone else | When do we start? |
| May 1, 2017 16:56:58 | Someone else | I'm could right now but otherwise 530. |
| May 1, 2017 17:00:56 | Someone else | I wrote down all loot, otherwise I'm getting on now  |

| May 4, 2017 20:28:53 | Someone else | So as I'm planning the next session I thought I would just mention that if you thought your time traveling jaunt through the Astral plane was weird I think you have all broken the timeline irreparably. +100xp I guess? |
| May 4, 2017 20:31:25 | Someone else | Eh? |
| May 4, 2017 20:32:00 | Someone else | He means we're level 10 now  |

| May 4, 2017 20:47:17 | Someone else | Hm. I-I don't know what to say. |

| May 8, 2017 16:47:11 | Brad | Is that a reference to something? I've seen you react that way twice now. |
| May 8, 2017 16:50:08 | Someone else | Sorry on my phone I can click something someone says and make a question mark, or exclamation point, or thumbs up etc. next to the message. For some reason not everyone sees it when that happens  |
| May 8, 2017 16:50:33 | Someone else | Attachment: image/png, So it appears like this  |
| May 9, 2017 21:17:29 | Someone else | Over the remainder of the day as you all complete your tasks you hear rumors that the gang of criminals you encountered have made their move in the harbor attacking the Harbor Authority building and killing all the council members within except the harbor master himself who barely survived.  Lieutenant Roe was was killed trying to defend them.  |
| May 15, 2017 12:42:22 | Someone else | Hey mates, making sure we're on for today. Also we should maybe turn our focus towards the docks, that shits crazy. |
| May 15, 2017 16:26:33 | Brad | Yep, still doing it tonight |
| May 15, 2017 16:55:32 | Someone else | Always |
| May 16, 2017 10:59:34 | Someone else | Amazing session everyone. I hope that combat didn't drag to long. Considering you tackled an encounter way earlier then I had intended in its hardest form you all perfored with aplomb. Enjoy level 7 everyone.  |

-An unsigned note |
| May 16, 2017 11:00:56 | Someone else | Dathrinir,
Enclosed is blessing from our King. Use it and it will allow us to commune within the shadows from hence forth. Our designs near Fort Locke have been delayed but I have decided you will continue your blessed work freeing slaves to join us in our holy calling. We still have not ascertained what the Gith are doing in the region but their raids along the High Road have been a boon to our efforts. Between them and petty squabbles within the city our work has gone nearly without problems. Before the next year has been heralded in our King will have returned to his rightful throne! Be warned BG has relocated to CK. The fool thinks to use us for his own ambitions but he will soon join us in shadows in ways he will never comprehend. Walk in shadows friend. |
| May 16, 2017 12:36:17 | Someone else | Evasion unlocked fireball me all you want.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:36:42 | Someone else | Oh, I will |
| May 16, 2017 12:37:40 | Someone else | Please, everyone stop using fire. Alassi is getting very depressed! |
| May 16, 2017 12:38:14 | Someone else | We will invest in something to take care of this issue for you, our barbarian friend.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:38:36 | Someone else | I can make fire resist potions? |
| May 16, 2017 12:44:17 | Someone else | If we can confirm a magic cloak won't end your Ã¡l Rambo benefits you can have the cloak  |
| May 16, 2017 12:45:27 | Someone else | EMOJI KA I'm so glad patsy didn't just go path of the bear, it's stupid good, but not nearly as much fun.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:46:15 | Brad | RAW, magic robes are not considered armor. Robe of the archmagi specifically states a benefit if the user is not wearing any armor. But I think Budde rules differently. |
| May 16, 2017 12:47:13 | Brad | But if Jake can just pump out large batches of potions per day, it's probably more efficient to do that. |
| May 16, 2017 12:47:54 | Someone else | I rule robes are armor. Cloaks however are not. |
| May 16, 2017 12:48:32 | Someone else | I also can fail potion making. Which sucks. Yesterday I failed a batch of 5 healing potions. (100 gp)  |
| May 16, 2017 12:50:56 | Someone else | But yeah I could start procuring fire resist potions. I plan on spending my share of the loot (post tithe) on recipes, and components for more potions. I've been assured my skills will increase along with the power of these potions.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:57:39 | Brad | Usually failing five potions would mean losing several hundred gp and five days lost. |
| May 16, 2017 12:58:57 | Brad | So I'm just saying be happy with what you have |
| May 16, 2017 13:00:15 | Someone else | We decided that 3 hours for a simple potion is adequate. And I can make up to five in like a 'batch' so long as I make one roll for the whole batch. It could be considerably worse. But it still sucks.  |
| May 16, 2017 13:07:45 | Brad | If we focus on fire as a party, things could get nasty. Vess now has a spell that removes resistances to fire and fire does an extra 2d6 damage, against one target for a minute. Any one element, since Alessi has a thunder sword. |
| May 16, 2017 13:45:55 | Someone else |  Oooo I Iike this for bosses |
| May 16, 2017 16:33:57 | Someone else | That sounds smart. I can make fire breathing potions!  |
| May 22, 2017 16:55:52 | Someone else | 5:30? |
| May 22, 2017 16:56:45 | Someone else | I'm game whenever |
| May 22, 2017 17:13:47 | Someone else | I'm trying to get confirmation from Brad. He was moving this weekend. If he is not free I would rather wait a week because we would be missing both Michael and Brad.  |
| May 22, 2017 17:16:59 | Brad | I forgot about it, but I should be set up in time. |
| May 22, 2017 17:17:01 | Someone else | Message delivery failure; Account is delinquent; please contact Project Fi Support (1-844-TALK2FI). |
| May 22, 2017 17:20:23 | Someone else | Yeah, unless there is a side quest down one of those tunnels???? |
| May 22, 2017 17:23:53 | Someone else | Sadly no :( |
| May 22, 2017 17:24:09 | Someone else | Sadly no side quest or sadly no playing today cuz Brad are a poop  |
| May 22, 2017 17:24:51 | Someone else | You are the dm.. aren't you the one with the ability to spawn a hidden society of mouse people in the caves? |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:19 | Someone else | No side quest. I'll wait til 6 and if I don't hear back we'll have to take a break for the week.  |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:30 | Someone else | I agree, and you can turn us all into cats, and do a mini adventure of cat and mouse |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:50 | Someone else | ^^ |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:51 | Someone else | You try calling him yet? |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:14 | Someone else | Just saying, I would love to be a cat |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:16 | Someone else | Alsassi might not |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:38 | Someone else | More like al sassy  |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:09 | Someone else | Sorry guys |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:23 | Someone else | But the mouse thing seems legit |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:49 | Someone else | It's ok!  |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:37 | Someone else | Looks like Brad can play! |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:45 | Someone else | Dope!! |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:50 | Someone else | Coming on  |
| May 22, 2017 17:31:23 | Someone else | Let the shenanigans begin |
| May 22, 2017 17:31:31 | Someone else | I was starting to get sad  |
| May 22, 2017 17:31:33 | Someone else | Right Patsy  |
| May 22, 2017 17:34:59 | Someone else | Need you to get on Skype Patsy Wait for it! |

| May 29, 2017 09:16:51 | Someone else | Today a thingy thing? |
| May 29, 2017 09:27:39 | Someone else | Yes sir. |
| May 29, 2017 09:30:10 | Someone else | My roommate has been interested in my talks of our adventures. I was wondering if you guys would be comfortable with him sitting in on this session or a future one. He said he would want to keep his mic muted to be a pure observer. I want to get him hooked sometime soon. |
| May 29, 2017 09:31:35 | Someone else | I'd be fine with that if everyone else is. I couldn't facilitate another member in this party however. |
| May 29, 2017 09:32:38 | Someone else | He just wants to watch, not play. |
| May 29, 2017 10:01:53 | Someone else | Yeah I don't mind a fan. Patsy and I have today off, but Michael works a normal day I think. So normal time? |
| May 29, 2017 10:02:35 | Someone else | Sounds good. |
| May 29, 2017 17:22:57 | Someone else | What threat threat will our heroes not take seriously this week? Maybe they'll make boner jokes at a skeleton, I don't know. IT'S THE ADVENTURE ZONE.  |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:34 | Someone else | Are people ready, I've got about 63 more of those to unleash if you aren't? |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:52 | Someone else | Bring em on.  |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:57 | Someone else | Patsy and I will be on shortly  |
| May 29, 2017 17:29:57 | Someone else | I'll drink up all the potions on your shelf, so let me introduce myself. IT'S NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 2! |
| Jun 11, 2017 13:29:34 | Someone else | Well well well Adventurers I hope you've enjoyed your brief respite but orcs, and priests, and traps await you all tomorrow! I hope you've been checking your shadows (oh wait they've disappeared)! |
| Jun 11, 2017 13:31:53 | Someone else | Heck ya let's do some killing!  |
| Jun 19, 2017 12:57:22 | Someone else | It's that time of the week again bois! We're all in oye! |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:05:48 | Someone else | So many orcs so little time.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:07:39 | Someone else | So much fire, so little resistance  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:07:58 | Someone else | Budde please don't kill me |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:09:02 | Someone else | I would never kill you Patsy! Khelgar would never forgive me.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:12:26 | Someone else | Attachment: image/gif, Very accurate depiction of our party.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:12:51 | Someone else | EMOJI KA |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:41:16 | Someone else | So...

| Jun 26, 2017 13:41:53 | Someone else | Not tonight. The lovebirds are off on their honeymoon.  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:49:29 | Someone else | Jake wanted me to ask if we planned to next week? |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:52:03 | Someone else | I would like to, but it depends on how Pope's feeling considering it will be ~2am in Germany.  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:52:47 | Someone else | 5+7 = 12 .. I'm down if I can get a set up  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:53:23 | Someone else | Ok! |

| Jul 5, 2017 18:36:35 | Someone else | Dope dude!  |
| Jul 10, 2017 09:22:33 | Someone else | So we got ahold of the pope-I-nator? |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:40:51 | Someone else | Not yet. I'll message him online. Having given it thought though we are in the middle of a dungeon crawl so him miss one session would not throw anything off so If everyone else is good I think we'll move ahead tonight regardless. |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:48:56 | Someone else | Let's do it up! |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:49:48 | Someone else | There are orcs to slaughter and miners to traumatize!  |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:55:28 | Brad | I'm always up for traumatizing minors! |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:56:16 | Someone else | Budum-tish |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:59:20 | Someone else | A Hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:00:02 | Someone else | We are making Heros |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:25:11 | Someone else | Liked âI'm always up for traumatizing minors!â |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:26:09 | Someone else | Lol. I'm down to continue if pope can't. I'd like him to be there. But if it's just dungeoning, it's not imperative.  |
| Jul 10, 2017 13:33:15 | Someone else | Pope's not sure on his Internet holding out but he's trying to install tabletop now. He said he's ok with the party moving forward but if his eye tries to make him do anything evil he wants the party to kill him. |
| Jul 10, 2017 13:41:30 | Someone else | Perfect practice for our minor friend  |
| Jul 10, 2017 15:36:35 | Someone else | Lol |
| Jul 10, 2017 17:21:58 | Someone else | Michael is running a bit late. Maybe 10 mins? |
| Jul 10, 2017 17:23:16 | Brad | Perfect! |
| Jul 10, 2017 17:30:37 | Someone else | You're perfect! |
| Jul 24, 2017 09:56:38 | Someone else | Patsy gets off work at 5:30 and won't be home until 6:00. We can start without her!  |
| Jul 24, 2017 10:37:18 | Someone else | Just don't get into any fights without me;) |
| Jul 24, 2017 11:15:31 | Someone else | I'll make them burn through all their fireballs. It will be all barbar from then on out.   |
| Jul 24, 2017 11:31:34 | Someone else | Blazing goblins for days! |
| Jul 24, 2017 12:19:14 | Someone else | Good! |
| Jul 31, 2017 12:52:26 | Someone else | Y'all ready for some Dnd dungeon action tonight?! |
| Jul 31, 2017 12:53:35 | Brad | I'm never ready.
In related news, do any of you happen to have an old Minnesota RenFest map/pamphlet? |
| Jul 31, 2017 12:54:39 | Someone else | That doesn't sound related... that being said, no. |
| Jul 31, 2017 12:54:41 | Someone else | I do not. |

| Jul 31, 2017 12:58:51 | Someone else | How old are we talking? |
| Jul 31, 2017 13:12:24 | Brad | I shouldn't have said old; the newer the better, but I don't think it has changed much for years. |
| Aug 7, 2017 17:22:23 | Someone else | Goonies never say die... but dungeon masters do ;) Buckle up adventurers  |
| Aug 7, 2017 17:28:58 | Someone else | :( |
| Aug 14, 2017 12:35:16 | Someone else | Patsys got the same story this week, she works till 5:30 so we'll start without her.  |
| Aug 21, 2017 13:08:16 | Someone else | What an excellent day to invade the fire nation or start a journey to save the cheerleader. But it's also a great day to do some Neverwintering!  |
| Aug 21, 2017 13:12:41 | Someone else | We got fucked out of seeing the eclipse.
I need to burn some bitches |
| Aug 21, 2017 14:36:13 | Someone else | I saw it! |
