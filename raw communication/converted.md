| Aug 29, 2014 13:49:56 | Brad | So do you want to do anything this weekend, PIEWOF-wise?
 |
| Aug 30, 2014 23:06:21 | Mitchell Budde | Leaving at noon tomorrow for Ren. |
| Aug 30, 2014 23:06:35 | Brad | Okay, thanks |
| Aug 31, 2014 11:35:18 | Brad | The light rail is broken. I should still make it in time, but no promises. |
| Aug 31, 2014 11:36:50 | Mitchell Budde | No worries! |
| Aug 31, 2014 12:07:52 | Brad | Here |
| Aug 31, 2014 12:09:51 | Mitchell Budde | Did you get in? |
| Aug 31, 2014 12:10:01 | Brad | yep |
| Oct 10, 2014 17:11:28 | Mitchell Budde | Works for me. |
| Nov 14, 2014 18:29:52 | Brad | couple minutes |
| Nov 15, 2014 13:47:48 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Dec 6, 2014 10:45:28 | Mitchell Budde | It does for me. |
| Dec 10, 2014 17:39:48 | Brad | What's our level in the Guild Wars campaign? |
| Dec 10, 2014 17:41:10 | Mitchell Budde | I believe you reached 5 at the end. |
| Dec 10, 2014 17:53:13 | Brad | That seemed to fit, thanks. |
| Dec 10, 2014 17:54:38 | Mitchell Budde | Anytime. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:23:59 | Brad | Where's the biomedical library? |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:25:35 | Mitchell Budde | Under Moos Tower. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:39:25 | Brad | I've entirely failed to find it. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:43:23 | Brad | never mind |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:44:31 | Mitchell Budde | I'm on the second floor. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:45:41 | Brad | I'm at the biomedical library now. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:51:17 | Mitchell Budde | I'm on the second floor. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:51:42 | Brad | Sorry, thought that sent. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:51:56 | Mitchell Budde | Second floor. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:52:54 | Mitchell Budde | I'm on the second floor. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:53:39 | Mitchell Budde | Techniquly the 3rd my bad. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:54:22 | Brad | Okay, you're in a giant, sprawling complex of buildings and refer to all of them as "under Moos Tower". "Second floor" doesn't work, just go back to the library and I'll find you. |
| Dec 16, 2014 11:55:48 | Mitchell Budde | 3rd floor in biomed library. Let me know when you get back to the library. |
| Dec 20, 2014 16:01:19 | Brad | What 3.5 books do you guys have? I want a little more variety than just PHB, and limiting it to what we have hard copies of should work well. |
| Dec 20, 2014 16:04:22 | Mitchell Budde | Among us we have phb 2, complete warrior, arcane, divine, and adventurer. There are a couple of forgotten realm supplaments. |
| Dec 20, 2014 16:05:00 | Brad | Okay, thanks. |
| Jan 13, 2015 17:19:24 | Brad | Presumably I haven't entirely missed the party? |
| Jan 13, 2015 17:33:45 | Brad | Despite you not answering, I assume I'm right. So I'll head over. Feel free to send me back, though. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:08:53 | Brad | quick, when is that party tomorrow? |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:09:24 | Mitchell Budde | Starts at 6. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:23:26 | Brad | Thanks. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:44:41 | Brad | I needed to figure out how long I could give them to tailor my suit. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:45:31 | Mitchell Budde | Oh haha. Can they do it in time? |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:46:15 | Brad | Apparently. Customer service is surreal when your clothes cost hundreds of dollars. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:47:00 | Mitchell Budde | Did you get a suit just for this? |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:47:39 | Brad | I got a suit because I keep running into situations in which I need one. I got it today because of this. |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:48:50 | Mitchell Budde | Glad to be of help? |
| Jan 23, 2015 17:49:24 | Brad | Definitely. |
| Jan 24, 2015 17:31:22 | Brad | It seems I'll be about 45 minutes late, in case you needed to know. |
| Jan 24, 2015 17:32:16 | Mitchell Budde | More than ok. It sounds like 6 was a bit early. |
| Jan 24, 2015 17:33:06 | Brad | Or we're all just lazy procrastinators. |
| Jan 24, 2015 18:14:20 | Brad | Eat before arriving? |
| Jan 24, 2015 18:17:47 | Mitchell Budde | We have appitizers, cake, and other snacks. Up to you. |
| Jan 25, 2015 13:27:44 | Brad | Will you be around the apartment today? I should probably go and pick up my boots. |
| Jan 25, 2015 13:36:19 | Mitchell Budde | I will. Stop by whenever. |
| Jan 25, 2015 16:50:59 | Brad | I'm at your door |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:07:17 | Mitchell Budde | Would you still be interested in dnd? |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:07:32 | Brad | ...tonight? |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:08:42 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:11:09 | Brad | Definitely. I need to finish making supper and eat it, though, not to mention getting to your house. Ice Wind Dale? |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:17:05 | Mitchell Budde | Yes. |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:26:13 | Brad | Okay, done with food. We have two options:
I take the train -- 40-60min
Someone drives over and picks me up -- ~15min |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:29:46 | Brad | You tend to not notice your phone, so I'm going to spam you a bit. |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:29:47 | Brad | I hope you don't mind. |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:30:16 | Mitchell Budde | Brophy's not here and I don't have a vehical here. So train... |
| Jan 31, 2015 18:30:26 | Brad | OIkay, will do. |
| Feb 2, 2015 15:28:49 | Brad | So DnD is likely this coming Saturday, yes? |
| Feb 2, 2015 16:00:40 | Mitchell Budde | Probably not. Both Blake and I will be studying for a Genetics exam. |
| Mar 2, 2015 14:27:28 | Mitchell Budde | Pure Bradfection. |
| Mar 6, 2015 14:03:10 | Mitchell Budde | I won't be around tonight, sorry. |
| Mar 13, 2015 21:29:26 | Mitchell Budde | Noon tomorrow work for you? |
| Mar 13, 2015 21:31:53 | Brad | sounds good |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:32:01 | Brad | You doing anything tonight? |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:33:32 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay's over but otherwise nothing. |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:34:24 | Brad | Okay, no pressure but would you want to do Halo with me and a friend? |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:35:25 | Mitchell Budde | We would love to! |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:40:24 | Brad | Sweet, it'll be half an hour. |
| Mar 18, 2015 17:42:44 | Mitchell Budde | Ok! See you in a bit. |
| Apr 17, 2015 18:32:36 | Brad | We still meeting in Coffman? |
| Apr 17, 2015 18:33:40 | Mitchell Budde | I'm there. |
| May 3, 2015 18:25:30 | Brad | I have a bunch of plastic bags. |
| May 3, 2015 18:32:38 | Mitchell Budde | I may steal some haha. |
| May 3, 2015 18:33:15 | Brad | No, you can't. I was just bragging. |
| May 3, 2015 18:34:08 | Mitchell Budde | Don't you mean bagging? |
| May 6, 2015 19:40:38 | Brad | Do you still want a bunch of plastic bags, and are you at you apartment? |
| May 6, 2015 19:42:28 | Mitchell Budde | I would but I am not at the apartment. |
| May 8, 2015 18:32:25 | Mitchell Budde | Will you be joining us for dinner? |
| May 8, 2015 18:32:41 | Brad | A minute away |
| May 8, 2015 18:33:30 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| May 15, 2015 18:32:39 | Mitchell Budde | I won't make it. |
| May 20, 2015 10:42:35 | Brad | Any chance you're at your apartment? I'm interested in borrowing some books you mentioned a few weeks ago. |
| May 20, 2015 11:34:00 | Mitchell Budde | I am, all day today and tomorrow. |
| May 20, 2015 11:34:58 | Brad | Do you remember what series it was? I should be able to be there in half an hour at most. |
| May 20, 2015 11:36:07 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. They're on my Kindle if that's ok. |
| May 20, 2015 11:36:28 | Brad | Oh right, I remember that now. Yeah, that'll be fine. |
| May 20, 2015 15:53:31 | Brad | Fantasy really likes impressive walls. |
| May 20, 2015 15:54:14 | Mitchell Budde | That they do. |
| May 21, 2015 14:04:37 | Brad | You still want some company today? |
| May 21, 2015 14:05:54 | Mitchell Budde | If you'd like. Lynnay and I are just sitting around playing Bloodborne. |
| May 21, 2015 14:06:42 | Brad | Okay, I'll head over. |
| May 25, 2015 12:06:59 | Brad | You home? I wanted to get your Kindle back to you. |
| May 25, 2015 12:09:35 | Mitchell Budde | Not until Wednesday. |
| May 27, 2015 19:33:17 | Brad | Mind if I drop by? |
| May 27, 2015 19:33:51 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all. |
| May 29, 2015 20:13:29 | Brad | Is PIEWOF hanging out tonight? |
| Jun 1, 2015 14:55:59 | Brad | You mind if I hang out until DnD? |
| Jun 1, 2015 14:56:38 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all. |
| Jun 6, 2015 14:09:50 | Brad | Any chance you could get some paper plates for me? It'd be appreciated. |
| Jun 6, 2015 14:10:38 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah! |
| Jun 7, 2015 13:35:45 | Mitchell Budde | Would you still like to dnd? |
| Jun 7, 2015 13:36:27 | Brad | Yep. I should be ready soon. |
| Jun 7, 2015 13:36:54 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Jun 8, 2015 17:09:54 | Mitchell Budde | I will when I get home. Should be in 30ish minutes if that's ok? |
| Jun 8, 2015 17:11:14 | Brad | Yeah, that's fine. I'm in no hurry. |
| Jun 11, 2015 13:49:31 | Mitchell Budde | So Lynnay and and I are shooting for today for dnd. Waiting to hear from Brophy. Just a heads up. |
| Jun 11, 2015 14:04:53 | Brad | Okay, I'll get ready |
| Jun 11, 2015 14:05:28 | Mitchell Budde | Mkay. |
| Jun 14, 2015 19:28:11 | Brad | Mind if I come over? |
| Jun 14, 2015 19:28:49 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all. |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:24:58 | Mitchell Budde | I may be able to get my hands on a 3ds. Would you be interested? |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:25:41 | Brad | That'd be great. |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:27:09 | Mitchell Budde | I will let you know. It's pink but I didn't think you'd mind. |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:27:57 | Brad | I don't even know if my enjoyment of pink is ironic anymore. |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:29:07 | Mitchell Budde | You're basically typecast at this point. |
| Jun 17, 2015 21:34:18 | Brad | All the world's a stage, so why not find a role you enjoy playing? |
| Jun 21, 2015 20:04:25 | Brad | Do you have the 3DS and game? |
| Jun 21, 2015 20:05:41 | Mitchell Budde | I have mine but my friend had already sold theirs when I asked. |
| Jun 21, 2015 20:06:05 | Brad | Ah, nevermind then. |
| Jun 21, 2015 20:06:57 | Mitchell Budde | Sorry. |
| Jun 26, 2015 12:03:10 | Brad | I have a friend who was thinking of joining us tonight but would prefer that we start at 6:00 rather than 6:30. Would that work? |
| Jun 26, 2015 12:06:40 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay isn't exactly sure when she'll be here other than it being "before 6:30" I'd say for Lynnay and I no. We could always meet everyone at bit late though. |
| Jun 26, 2015 12:08:06 | Brad | Hmm, okay. Thanks. |
| Jun 26, 2015 16:13:32 | Mitchell Budde | I don't know if this is still relevent but Lynnay got off early and is on her way. So 6 would work. |
| Jun 26, 2015 17:18:15 | Mitchell Budde | Did you make a reservation? I missed the post about it. |
| Jun 26, 2015 17:18:55 | Brad | nope, we'll just have to hope. |
| Jul 2, 2015 14:27:01 | Mitchell Budde | Up to anything tonight? |
| Jul 2, 2015 14:27:33 | Brad | Sorta. What are you planning? |
| Jul 2, 2015 14:30:08 | Mitchell Budde | Whenever Blake gets home from work Lynnay wanted to try and run a bit of her campaign. Otherwise we were going to watch series five of full metal if you were intrested. |
| Jul 2, 2015 14:31:38 | Brad | Shit, I forgot that you didn't have that before. I guess You've figured it out, though. And I'd go for some D&D. |
| Jul 2, 2015 14:34:05 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. Blake is usually back around 6:30 but you're welcome whenever. |
| Jul 2, 2015 16:51:50 | Brad | Fuck, is Lynnay already there? I forgot we needed to roleplay a bit. |
| Jul 2, 2015 16:52:31 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah she's here. |
| Jul 2, 2015 16:57:37 | Brad | I'll make sure I have everything ready and then head over. |
| Jul 2, 2015 16:58:15 | Mitchell Budde | Ok! |
| Jul 13, 2015 13:47:07 | Mitchell Budde | Hey, you doing anything tonight? |
| Jul 13, 2015 13:47:17 | Brad | Probably not |
| Jul 13, 2015 13:49:43 | Mitchell Budde | Would you be interested in hanging out and/or doing a pick up session tonight? |
| Jul 13, 2015 13:53:19 | Brad | Sounds good. Time? |
| Jul 13, 2015 13:55:48 | Mitchell Budde | Blake said he would be home later as far as dnd would go so like 7:30ish maybe, but your welcome whenever. Lynnay and I are just hanging out at the moment. |
| Jul 13, 2015 14:00:35 | Brad | I'll probably head over in a few hours when I've finished laundry. |
| Jul 13, 2015 14:01:19 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. See you in a bit. |
| Jul 15, 2015 18:40:08 | Brad | You free? I was going to print off some sheets and give some to you. |
| Jul 15, 2015 18:44:26 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Jul 18, 2015 16:35:05 | Mitchell Budde | So it looks like we won't be doing the one off tomorrow. Either continuing Lynnays campaign or starting NWN2 |
| Jul 20, 2015 21:02:10 | Brad | How long do you and Lynnay and Blake probably stay up on weeknights? Ever since you said you were already reading about Golarion and making a character, I've not quite been sure when people expect to do this. I want to drop by at some point and see what everyone thinks. |
| Jul 20, 2015 22:05:25 | Mitchell Budde | Probably not tomorrow but after that. |
| Jul 20, 2015 22:06:01 | Brad | Sounds good. |
| Jul 22, 2015 19:24:46 | Brad | Would I be able to drop by for, say, an hour? |
| Jul 22, 2015 19:25:24 | Mitchell Budde | Sure thing! |
| Jul 31, 2015 18:39:19 | Mitchell Budde | I will not make it. |
| Jul 31, 2015 19:27:58 | Mitchell Budde | Would you be down to start NWN2 this Sunday? |
| Jul 31, 2015 19:28:12 | Brad | yes |
| Jul 31, 2015 19:28:43 | Mitchell Budde | Perfect. |
| Jul 31, 2015 19:30:37 | Brad | I'll write up a character summary and character sheet tonight (I won't be any PC's sibling unless they really want to), and hopefully have a fuller backstory Saturday. |
| Jul 31, 2015 19:34:42 | Mitchell Budde | I would appreciate it. Also I will be allowing rolls if people would rather than point buy seeing as magical items and healing are somewhat gated. |
| Jul 31, 2015 20:15:46 | Brad | I'll do both, and then go with whichever one is more popular. |
| Jul 31, 2015 20:20:10 | Mitchell Budde | Sounds good. |
| Aug 2, 2015 12:00:34 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay gets off work at 5. If people can show up then we'll get sheets made and start right when Lynnay gets back. |
| Aug 2, 2015 13:41:21 | Brad | Mind if I arrive in an hour? |
| Aug 2, 2015 13:41:47 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all. |
| Aug 7, 2015 17:17:18 | Mitchell Budde | Piewof tonight? |
| Aug 7, 2015 17:20:20 | Brad | Nope, too busy moving out. |
| Aug 7, 2015 17:21:19 | Mitchell Budde | That's right. Well have a good weekend. |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:47:35 | Brad | Feel like being a guinea pig? |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:48:11 | Mitchell Budde | Maybe? |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:49:53 | Brad | It shouldn't take much time, and it's for a linguistics class. I don't think it's possible to have a dangerous linguistics experiment. |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:50:31 | Mitchell Budde | Then sure. What do you need? |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:50:57 | Brad | Well, I guess I could take your firstborn and raise it in a languageless environment. |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:51:51 | Brad | I'll just stop by tonight a bit after 7:30? |
| Sep 16, 2015 16:52:22 | Mitchell Budde | Sure thing. |
| Sep 18, 2015 18:35:06 | Brad | PIEWOF? |
| Sep 18, 2015 18:35:44 | Mitchell Budde | I will not make it. |
| Sep 28, 2015 16:07:38 | Brad | So what's up with RenFest this weekend? |
| Sep 28, 2015 16:09:07 | Mitchell Budde | I'll confirm with Brophy but we should be going Saturday morning. |
| Sep 28, 2015 16:09:33 | Brad | Okay, sounds good. |
| Sep 28, 2015 21:11:00 | Mitchell Budde | Brophy wants to leave by 11 on saturday. |
| Oct 2, 2015 13:46:19 | Brad | PIEWOF today? |
| Oct 2, 2015 13:46:42 | Mitchell Budde | Yep! |
| Oct 3, 2015 10:03:35 | Brad | I'm planning to arrive in under half an hour. If you need me to I can use a bike to go faster. |
| Oct 9, 2015 14:20:36 | Brad | Are you busy tonight? |
| Oct 9, 2015 14:58:57 | Mitchell Budde | No, what's up. |
| Oct 9, 2015 15:13:44 | Brad | A friend of mine likes Mario Kart, so I was working something out with Blake to see if we'd play tonight, probably after PIEWOF. |
| Oct 9, 2015 15:14:25 | Mitchell Budde | I'd be down. |
| Oct 9, 2015 15:15:26 | Brad | Sweet. |
| Oct 10, 2015 21:13:24 | Brad | If you're at your apartment, I could get my stuff |
| Oct 10, 2015 21:14:01 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Nov 15, 2015 22:42:13 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah! |
| Nov 15, 2015 22:46:28 | Brad | I'll drop by around eleven. |
| Nov 27, 2015 13:42:25 | Brad | So is Jared still moving out? |
| Nov 27, 2015 14:14:29 | Brad | That text that was probably from an unknown number was me. |
| Nov 27, 2015 14:18:10 | Mitchell Budde | I'll ask next time I see him. |
| Nov 27, 2015 14:21:00 | Brad | Thanks. I just realized there's a slim possibility I could actually still do that. |
| Nov 28, 2015 09:07:10 | Mitchell Budde | Are you in the cities and/or free today? |
| Nov 28, 2015 09:21:43 | Brad | Not free until five, but yes |
| Nov 28, 2015 09:23:21 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. We're doing a pickup dnd game today if you'd like to swing by then. |
| Nov 28, 2015 09:24:47 | Brad | Sounds good |
| Nov 28, 2015 17:04:31 | Mitchell Budde | If you're still interested we're still playing. |
| Nov 30, 2015 18:51:26 | Mitchell Budde | Looks like Jared will be moving out. |
| Nov 30, 2015 18:53:36 | Brad | Okay, thanks. Still not sure I'll move (assuming you want me), but I'll probably try. |
| Nov 30, 2015 18:54:25 | Mitchell Budde | We definitely want you. |
| Nov 30, 2015 18:55:14 | Brad | What's rent? |
| Nov 30, 2015 18:55:56 | Mitchell Budde | 540 |
| Dec 2, 2015 11:48:22 | Brad | So I want to watch Star Wars 4-6 some time soon, because I feel like I'm going to end up seeing 7. I felt like you might be interested (or maybe Blake). |
| Dec 2, 2015 11:57:37 | Mitchell Budde | Hell yeah! |
| Dec 2, 2015 12:17:49 | Brad | Okay, I tend to be most free wednesday-saturday. Doesn't really matter when we do it, but probably sometime before the 17th. |
| Dec 2, 2015 20:40:31 | Mitchell Budde | I don't know how early you'd want to start but I woul be free tomorrow afternon. |
| Dec 3, 2015 10:47:12 | Brad | When works? Oh, and somewhat importantly, do you have a way of watching it? |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:25:39 | Brad | Yo? |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:32:30 | Mitchell Budde | What's up? |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:32:56 | Brad | Did you want to watch today? |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:39:26 | Mitchell Budde | Oh! I never heard back so I wasn't sure. Blake and I are going to watch the video game awards but afterwards I would be down. You're also welcome to join for the awards. |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:40:01 | Brad | I texted this morning. Don't know if my phone messed up or something. |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:41:14 | Mitchell Budde | Oh. Sorry I don't have a text from you. |
| Dec 3, 2015 18:54:30 | Brad | Odd. |
| Dec 3, 2015 19:54:47 | Brad | I was thinking I would, but probably not. We should soon, though. Also, you don't happen to own them, do you? |
| Dec 3, 2015 20:33:01 | Mitchell Budde | I do. |
| Dec 3, 2015 22:23:29 | Brad | Invitation still open? |
| Dec 3, 2015 22:25:28 | Mitchell Budde | Probably not tonight. |
| Dec 3, 2015 22:25:47 | Brad | Mmkay, just checking
 |
| Dec 4, 2015 20:26:42 | Mitchell Budde | I just got back. Free to watch A New Hope. |
| Dec 4, 2015 20:41:00 | Brad | Yeah, that sounds good. I'll see how long it'll take. |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:32:43 | Brad | Just nevermind. |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:33:08 | Brad | lots of things going wrong |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:33:25 | Mitchell Budde | How long what takes? |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:34:21 | Mitchell Budde | Everything alright? |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:34:59 | Brad | Yeah, but phone died for a while and my friends are insane. |
| Dec 4, 2015 21:35:25 | Mitchell Budde | Ah. |
| Dec 7, 2015 18:52:05 | Brad | When does Jared plan to move out? |
| Dec 7, 2015 21:28:55 | Mitchell Budde | First or second week of January. |
| Dec 10, 2015 17:02:47 | Brad | You're setting up D&D for Wednesday, right? |
| Dec 10, 2015 17:08:16 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Dec 10, 2015 17:10:42 | Brad | Mmkay. I was suddenly scheduled for that, so I'll see if I can swap shifts. |
| Dec 11, 2015 18:24:06 | Brad | I'll be late, but probably less than five minutes. |
| Dec 14, 2015 17:06:49 | Brad | Is there a schedule for Wednesday? |
| Dec 14, 2015 17:09:50 | Mitchell Budde | Meet around 4ish is my understanding. |
| Dec 14, 2015 21:07:59 | Brad | I'm thinking I'll bring sandwiches for everyone. Sound good? |
| Dec 14, 2015 21:12:04 | Mitchell Budde | I'm down for sandwhiches. |
| Dec 15, 2015 22:20:55 | Mitchell Budde | So both Taylor and Brophy canceled. You're still welcome to come over but we will not be running that campaign. |
| Dec 15, 2015 22:33:31 | Brad | Lame. Well, I'd still like to come over and do whatever. What kind of sandwiches do you, Lynnay,and Blake like? |
| Dec 15, 2015 22:35:52 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay likes the Tuna one, and I get the Tullius. Blake is sleeping I believe so I will ask tomorrow. Also Lynnay says you are the best. |
| Dec 18, 2015 21:57:29 | Brad | You're done with finals? |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:22:24 | Mitchell Budde | I am! |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:30:14 | Brad | So you'll just be around until Christmas, right? |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:41:02 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. I leave Wednesday. |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:42:37 | Brad | If you're free tonight, we could watch ep. 6. |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:43:45 | Mitchell Budde | I am in St. cloud unfortunately. |
| Dec 18, 2015 22:44:45 | Brad | Right, I remember that now.  |
| Jan 4, 2016 20:27:17 | Mitchell Budde | Random question but does the word Nozawa mean anything in Japanese? |
| Jan 4, 2016 20:31:16 | Brad | It's a name, and if you see how it's spelled it has a vague meaning, but I don't think it means anything as a word. |
| Jan 4, 2016 20:32:47 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. The restaurant we're eating at is called that so I was curious.  |
| Jan 4, 2016 20:33:21 | Brad | Probably is random or just a reference to the place named Nozawa. |
| Jan 4, 2016 20:34:05 | Mitchell Budde | Ah. Well thank you. |
| Jan 17, 2016 15:34:34 | Brad | If we're all completely cornered and losing badly, is it okay if I attack party members? |
| Jan 17, 2016 15:35:26 | Brad | That would obviously be the end of playing that character. |
| Jan 17, 2016 15:36:03 | Mitchell Budde | You may. |
| Jan 30, 2016 15:37:28 | Brad | So I'm a noble who was cursed by a witch I pissed off. I must now accept any suggestion or request given to me.  |
| Mar 25, 2016 11:17:37 | Brad | Feel free to open my package if you want. |
| Mar 30, 2016 15:56:56 | Brad | So I'm thinking about being a werewolf. Obviously this would cause a whole bunch of complications we'd need to discuss if I do it, but it could be interesting. I left the monster manual on the coffee table if you need to look up lycanthropes, and I probably won't see you until tomorrow. |
| Mar 30, 2016 17:58:39 | Mitchell Budde | I reserve the right to call you Jacob. But yeah I will take a look over it for you.  |
| Apr 3, 2016 23:12:38 | Brad | When I grabbed the silver, I realized that I don't know if I can usually grab silver. There isn't anything that specifically says they can't touch silver, just that silvered weapons get past their resistance. You can call what you want. |
| Apr 3, 2016 23:13:52 | Mitchell Budde | You can touch it. But it makes you very uncomfortable. |
| Apr 14, 2016 15:47:25 | Brad | When did you expect to do D&D? |
| Apr 14, 2016 15:53:35 | Mitchell Budde | Start 5ish. |
| Apr 15, 2016 17:47:11 | Brad | We doing dinner? |
| Apr 15, 2016 17:51:29 | Mitchell Budde | No clue. |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:06:10 | Brad | Is there an apartment first aid kit? |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:06:59 | Mitchell Budde | I don't think so. You ok? |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:07:12 | Brad | Just scraped up |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:08:17 | Mitchell Budde | I have hydrogen Peroxide and band-aides if you need them.  |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:09:03 | Brad | The peroxide would be appreciated.  |
| Apr 21, 2016 14:09:33 | Mitchell Budde | Sure thing. |
| May 19, 2016 12:35:52 | Brad | Don't know ifyou were actually planning something, but today I won't be back before 2. |
| Jul 11, 2016 17:46:58 | Brad | https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic |
| Jul 22, 2016 13:11:48 | Mitchell Budde | Do you have an ETA when you'll be back at the apartment? |
| Sep 18, 2016 17:20:18 | Brad | What's the address? |
| Sep 18, 2016 17:21:24 | Mitchell Budde | 7509 Lyndale Ave S Richfield MN Apt 112 |
| Sep 25, 2016 16:05:15 | Mitchell Budde | Can I get the address we're playing dnd at? |
| Sep 25, 2016 16:05:34 | Brad | 301 Shelard pkwy |
| Sep 25, 2016 16:05:58 | Mitchell Budde | Danke |
| Sep 30, 2016 17:49:51 | Mitchell Budde | If you're still good for tomorrow I will pick you up around 10:45 am if that's ok. |
| Sep 30, 2016 17:52:14 | Brad | Sure |
| Sep 30, 2016 17:52:50 | Mitchell Budde | Thank you again, and sorry for for just springing this on you. |
| Sep 30, 2016 17:54:00 | Brad | It's really no problem. And giving me two days' warning is plenty. |
| Sep 30, 2016 17:55:20 | Mitchell Budde | Well you know me, I have to feel badly about everything always being the burden I am. |
| Sep 30, 2016 18:00:47 | Brad | Okay, maybe a change of plans. Would it work if I got to your house between 10 and 10:30, and we go from there? |
| Sep 30, 2016 18:01:33 | Mitchell Budde | Would you bike?  |
| Sep 30, 2016 18:03:45 | Brad | I'm bringing Nick's car back from the airport around then. |
| Sep 30, 2016 18:04:10 | Mitchell Budde | Oh ok. Yeah that's fine with me. |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:19:38 | Brad | Mind if I come in and use your microwave? |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:20:08 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all. Are you here? |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:21:10 | Brad | Yep |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:21:31 | Mitchell Budde | Be right down. |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:23:26 | Mitchell Budde | I do not see you. |
| Oct 1, 2016 10:23:49 | Brad | Sorry, tailgated in and thought you were second floor. |
| Oct 1, 2016 15:55:50 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay and I will be apple picking bit it probably wouldn't be all afternoon.  |
| Oct 1, 2016 15:56:52 | Brad | Dorks. |
| Oct 1, 2016 15:58:12 | Mitchell Budde | Uhhhh yeah. |
| Oct 9, 2016 09:25:48 | Brad | Is Monday night an option? |
| Oct 9, 2016 09:26:20 | Mitchell Budde | I would be free but Lynnay works. |
| Oct 9, 2016 09:26:29 | Brad | Okay. |
| Oct 16, 2016 18:46:28 | Mitchell Budde | I realize this may be somewhat of a retcon but Amara was not able to destroy all of her mother's works and to keep them from the cult keeps what she could scrounge up in a grimoire. To this point she has not read any of it but last night she spent a good deal of time contemplating reading from it. If you're cool with that. |
| Oct 16, 2016 18:46:52 | Brad | Ooooooh |
| Oct 16, 2016 21:44:27 | Mitchell Budde | While they are discussing this I try and collect some blood the cut. |
| Oct 16, 2016 21:45:24 | Brad | Roll sleight of hand |
| Oct 16, 2016 21:45:57 | Mitchell Budde | 14 |
| Oct 17, 2016 13:03:10 | Brad | Turns out I have to work tonight. |
| Oct 17, 2016 13:13:31 | Mitchell Budde | That's alright. Any Monday is pretty good for me. |
| Oct 17, 2016 13:14:02 | Brad | I'm generally not busy, so hopefully next week. |
| Oct 17, 2016 13:14:21 | Mitchell Budde | Alright! |
| Oct 24, 2016 13:41:43 | Mitchell Budde | I'm going to make some lunch and head over if that is alright. |
| Oct 24, 2016 13:42:09 | Brad | Sounds good. |
| Oct 24, 2016 14:28:07 | Mitchell Budde | Outside |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:42:51 | Mitchell Budde | Any luck figuring out how we goofed? We weren't supposed to throw the guy in the tv were we? |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:44:13 | Brad | We are supposed to keep him alive and convince the others that we're missing a piece of the puzzle. |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:44:37 | Mitchell Budde | Is that not what we did? |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:45:43 | Brad | We tried and failed. The correct route doesn't make much sense to me. |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:47:04 | Mitchell Budde | Hmm.... it just wouldn't be a jrpg without at least one esoteric puzzle. |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:48:26 | Mitchell Budde | Or covaluted as it were. |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:56:50 | Brad | I'm pretty unimpressed with how they handle conversation choices. Too often they're pointless illusions, and then suddenly you've got a series of super difficult choices that prematurely end the game. |
| Oct 25, 2016 17:57:41 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah that's not a great design choice. |
| Oct 30, 2016 17:44:57 | Mitchell Budde | I have arrived. |
| Oct 31, 2016 14:47:03 | Mitchell Budde | Alright if I head over now? |
| Oct 31, 2016 14:50:37 | Brad | Yep |
| Oct 31, 2016 15:20:06 | Mitchell Budde | I have arrived. |
| Nov 3, 2016 21:19:43 | Brad | What do you think about doing Persona this Sunday? |
| Nov 3, 2016 21:20:43 | Mitchell Budde | Works for me. |
| Nov 5, 2016 14:13:55 | Mitchell Budde | What time do you want me to stop by tomorrow? |
| Nov 5, 2016 14:14:57 | Brad | Whenever after 12:00, probably. I have to make sure I'm home by then, though. |
| Nov 5, 2016 14:15:43 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. I'll give you a heads up when I leave. |
| Nov 6, 2016 12:49:40 | Mitchell Budde | Alright if I come over? |
| Nov 6, 2016 12:55:27 | Brad | Yep |
| Nov 6, 2016 13:24:31 | Mitchell Budde | Here. |
| Nov 12, 2016 20:54:58 | Brad | In case Lynnay happens to look at your phone by accident, I'm putting space here. It's about Amara.




I'd like two things from you: 
A summary of what Amara has done so far regarding her parents and whatnot.
A list of what Amara currently possesses, including everything from magic items to mundane hair brushes. It isn't the end of the world if it's not exhaustive, but you can think of it as an exercise in roleplay. |
| Nov 13, 2016 11:09:57 | Brad | I think if they really want to have a surprise ending in Persona 5, they should actually end it the first time everyone says "It's finally over". |
| Nov 13, 2016 11:10:23 | Brad | And the fool arcana will be at 6. |
| Nov 13, 2016 11:51:46 | Mitchell Budde | Wait are you sure there wasn't someone else pulling the strings? Yes, we're sure. |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:06:55 | Brad | Do you have any planned hooks for this one off? |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:07:28 | Mitchell Budde | Yes. |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:09:10 | Brad | I guess I'm thinking character hooks, and now I'm doubting whether the term can be used that way. Anyway, whenever you can give me a quick rundown of what I can use to get my character interested I'd appreciate it. |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:16:15 | Mitchell Budde | I'll send out some lore stuff if people want it but the 3 main hooks I have will each have a different focus. The first is a war between humans and centaurs and will be more combat focused. The next will be bandit clans uniting and the rumors surrounding why that's happening it will be more skill and investigation based. The third will be working with a group of powerful orders to tackle the rising dragon threat to the south which will have a bit of everything. This will be set in the GW universe  =200 after the other campaign you were apart of.  |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:19:58 | Brad | Okay, that's pretty much all I needed. Sorry if my texts didn't make sense; I was napping but was jolted awake by the thought that the session is in six days and I have no idea what my character is. It needed an immediate response. |
| Nov 14, 2016 16:22:16 | Mitchell Budde | Haha it's ok. Any of the hooks can be picked up and dropped and continued with any with or without other people. If you don't want to be human though let me know I'm deciding what templates to use for the Tyrian races. |
| Nov 15, 2016 13:17:45 | Brad | If you're not busy and have dice handy, want to roll me six ability scores? Keep them in the order you roll them if you do. |
| Nov 15, 2016 14:41:30 | Mitchell Budde | 14, 13, 12, 16, 13, 13 |
| Nov 15, 2016 14:44:08 | Brad | Ah, thank you. Though, now that I've thought about it, what would you say to 6d20? |
| Nov 15, 2016 14:45:08 | Mitchell Budde | I'm not opposed if you're ready for sub 10 stats. |
| Nov 15, 2016 14:45:31 | Brad | I am so ready. |
| Nov 15, 2016 15:11:27 | Mitchell Budde | 14, 13, 12, 16, 13, 13 |
| Nov 15, 2016 15:32:25 | Brad | Your phone re-sent those die rolls, and for a while I thought you had rolled for me and managed to get me the most boring 6d20 roll I could imagine.  |
| Nov 15, 2016 15:38:44 | Mitchell Budde |  Did it? I just wanted to know if you wanted me to roll or if you were going to? |
| Nov 15, 2016 15:39:55 | Brad | My phone says it did, so who knows which one had the problem. And I'll do it myself. I've got a whole convoluted plan ready. |
| Nov 15, 2016 15:40:26 | Mitchell Budde | Haha alright. Let me know what you get. |
| Nov 15, 2016 16:33:41 | Brad | 20 Str, 8 Dex, 12 Con, 11 Int, 9 Wis, 16 Cha (pre-race). Not really the sub 10 results I was expecting, but I'm sure I'll make up for that next time I roll like this. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:39:36 | Mitchell Budde | Are you going to roll or I? |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:40:56 | Brad | Did you not get the text at 4:30? |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:42:19 | Mitchell Budde | Sorry yes I did. I've been splitting tome actually working and also typing up stuff for Sunday. That will make for an interesting character to be sure. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:44:31 | Brad | It's almost Captain Hammer-ish, now that I look at it.

 I wasn't too excited at first, but it made me realize that I pretty much never play characters with Str as the main stat. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:45:27 | Mitchell Budde | Especially if people want to go a more skill route haha. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:50:26 | Brad | Cha tends to be useful in those sorts of scenarios. Yeah, the more I look at this the more I feel like it'll be interesting and I'll still get to be useful. I was mentally preparing for something like 18 Wis, 2 Int |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:51:46 | Mitchell Budde | I was too. That actually looks like a character someone could roll normally sans the 20. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:55:34 | Brad | So the question is, what happens if I pick a race that ups Str? I don't plan to search one out and I haven't even looked at GW races yet, but with the vague idea in my head I imagine I'll pick a race that would have either a STR or CON buff. Something imposing, but with which I could still seem traditionally handsome. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:56:48 | Mitchell Budde | I'd probably let you swap a strength buff with cons or dex. I wouldn't allow it to break 20. |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:58:38 | Brad | Mmkay, sounds good. So we're set in Tyria around when GW2 is happening? And I'm guessing you'll be pulling heavily from official quests? |
| Nov 15, 2016 18:59:29 | Mitchell Budde | That's the plan. |
| Nov 16, 2016 07:54:48 | Brad | Any houserules for paladins? |
| Nov 16, 2016 09:06:15 | Brad | BecUse it's looking like a human Ancients paladin, but with a more Cayden Cailean feel to it than the traditional paladin. |
| Nov 16, 2016 09:25:22 | Mitchell Budde | I think humans would nicely into any of the 3 paths. The closest the game has to the paladin is the Guardian class which would also fit with the devotion track. |
| Nov 16, 2016 15:47:23 | Brad | Kayden: male, human (+1 Cha, +1 Int, Actor, Athletics), background (Deception, History, blacksmith's tools, whatever language the Orrian nobility spoke, a fine set of full plate and greatsword, overdue debt to the shady organization that paid for said equipment), Paladin (Insight, Persuasion, Great weapon fighting, Oath of the Ancients).

Ostensibly a proud native of Divinity's Reach, he hides his Orrian heritage because people seem to find it shameful, though he doesn't understand why and is privately very proud of it. His first cousin many times removed is King Reza. He would jump at a good opportunity to fight to restore Orr, but is afraid to stand out if the assault doesn't have much support. The organization he borrowed from is rarely seen in Divinity's Reach, but he's heard rumors that they've been increasing their power wherever we start this thing.

How does that look? I've got more personality detail in my head, but this seems most relevant to you. The only thing I'm really concerned about is that full plate. I don't know if a 3rd level should have it even with the threat of death via loanshark, but I do like it for the flavor and that AC is super nice. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:01:26 | Mitchell Budde | I will allow it but don't think for a second that debt won't be due. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:03:24 | Brad | At first I was just thinking of how I'd roleplay his paranoia. It honestly took me a few hours to realize that you could liter |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:03:42 | Brad | *literally have them attack me to collect on the debt. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:04:24 | Mitchell Budde | It would fit nicely with one of the narrative threads. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:05:19 | Brad | Oh good |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:06:05 | Brad | I haven't looked around the wiki to see if I can find any criminal organizations, but I can if you want. Or if you already have something in mind I won't bother. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:16:21 | Mitchell Budde | I'd rather it be a suprise of it comes up.  |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:20:13 | Brad | I guess I don't know what you want the surprise to be. Presumably Kayden knows who he borrowed from, and I felt like having a name and some sort of sign of them would make it better (equivalent to gang tags or specific colors). I wasn't expecting to know how or when or if I'd actually be accosted. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:22:26 | Mitchell Budde | Ah fair enough. It was an Asuran group that intoduced themselves as representatives of the College of Inquest. Not sure how open you would have been but they would be interested in your heritage and wish to reclaim Orr. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:31:54 | Brad | Kayden would not be very open, but his mother was a paladin  of some renown who openly talked of retaking Orr. She's dead and he doesn't really talk about her, but a group investigating her could probably find out about him and assume he had similar wishes. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:33:47 | Mitchell Budde | Fair enough. You knew they were in the capital trying  to open trade relations with the humans. Currently the Black Lion Trade company holds a monopoly on almost all trade between the races. |
| Nov 16, 2016 18:43:10 | Brad | Ooh, they even have a creepy sigil. Sounds good then. |
| Nov 17, 2016 17:58:46 | Brad | So, rules question: 
Great Weapon Fighter: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll...
Along with spells that say "the [melee] attack deals an extra 1d6 of [the same type of/a different type of] damage" |
| Nov 17, 2016 18:00:16 | Mitchell Budde | I'm not seeing the question... |
| Nov 17, 2016 18:01:37 | Brad | Does the class feature apply to extra damage from spells? |
| Nov 17, 2016 18:03:01 | Mitchell Budde | Ah. I would say not as the feature seems to be tied directly to your use of the weapon. |
| Nov 17, 2016 18:03:45 | Brad | That seems like the reasonable answer. |
| Nov 19, 2016 09:46:19 | Brad | Nick might be joining us. He had a flat and had to call off his trip. |
| Nov 19, 2016 09:48:10 | Mitchell Budde | We can do Rise if that's the case. |
| Nov 19, 2016 09:50:42 | Brad | I probably won't be ready. |
| Nov 19, 2016 10:05:13 | Mitchell Budde | Ah. Well I'm kinda sorta maybe ready which is where I'm always at for dming |
| Nov 25, 2016 07:58:45 | Brad | You and/or Lynnay want to do anything Sunday? |
| Nov 25, 2016 09:09:10 | Mitchell Budde | Dnd fall through? |
| Nov 25, 2016 09:09:53 | Brad | Just checkin on availability. |
| Nov 25, 2016 09:10:33 | Mitchell Budde | Ah. Yeah we want to do something. |
| Nov 25, 2016 09:13:17 | Brad | And do you want to DM? |
| Nov 25, 2016 09:14:15 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah I'd be down to do that. |
| Nov 27, 2016 17:12:24 | Mitchell Budde | Just leaving now. I will be a bit late. |
| Nov 27, 2016 17:38:45 | Mitchell Budde | Outside. |
| Nov 27, 2016 18:50:47 | Mitchell Budde | For the moment they have just congratulated you on your new title and the hope that you will remember who your benefactors were. |
| Nov 27, 2016 18:51:24 | Brad | New title? |
| Nov 27, 2016 18:51:58 | Mitchell Budde | Hero of Shaemore is an actual title. |
| Dec 1, 2016 13:51:58 | Brad | Do you know a logo that's grey and blue, has a shield in the background, and like a black swan or something in the foreground? |
| Dec 1, 2016 13:57:14 | Mitchell Budde | Are we talking from real life or something fictional? |
| Dec 1, 2016 14:51:31 | Brad | I've seen it on a few bumper stickers, but haven't had the time to take a closer look. |
| Dec 1, 2016 14:53:05 | Mitchell Budde | Not that I can think of. |
| Dec 1, 2016 14:54:40 | Brad | Mmkay, thanks |
| Dec 3, 2016 18:14:45 | Brad | So Lynnay can't make it tomorrow? |
| Dec 3, 2016 18:31:01 | Brad | Nevermind, I see the post. |
| Dec 3, 2016 18:56:47 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. I won't make it either.  |
| Dec 3, 2016 18:57:10 | Brad | Ah, good to know. |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:23:16 | Brad | We made a terrible mistake. If you actually become Yosuke's friend, you get to beat him up at the end. |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:23:47 | Mitchell Budde | Wait really? |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:24:17 | Brad | Well, the two of you fistfight. |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:24:54 | Mitchell Budde | What is the impetus for the fight? |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:25:42 | Brad | Yosuke's jealous and he wants you to beat the jealousy out of him. |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:26:07 | Mitchell Budde | What? |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:26:34 | Brad | Look, he doesn't get any smarter. |
| Dec 10, 2016 21:29:02 | Mitchell Budde | You should have left him in the garbage where he belonged. Well you did but.... still. |
| Dec 27, 2016 14:09:40 | Brad | Does Forgotten Realms have a leader god? |
| Dec 27, 2016 14:27:47 | Mitchell Budde | Ao |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:27:42 | Brad | Do you want the bard, arcane, paladin, or elemental spell cards? |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:28:29 | Mitchell Budde | Um I have arcane. Let's go paladin. |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:37:10 | Brad | You might think I'm a procrastinator because I waited until the day of your party to buy you a present. But in truth I just happened across these and the thought of getting them for you as a birthday present did not occur to me until after you had texted back. |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:38:37 | Mitchell Budde | Haha it's ok. I would honestly be fine with no gifts. It'll just be nice to see everyone again. |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:40:04 | Brad | Yeah, I was pretty sure PIEWOF has never expected gifts from eachother. It was just weird to realize what I was doing after I did it. |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:40:33 | Brad | Otherwise I probably would have been more secretive. And maybe gotten wrapping paper. |
| Jan 7, 2017 11:40:48 | Mitchell Budde | Makes sense. |
| Jan 8, 2017 11:01:16 | Brad | So are you up for tonight, and do you want a ride? |
| Jan 8, 2017 12:38:14 | Brad | Mitch? |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:07:45 | Brad | Some of the clothes you left in the room are missing. |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:08:47 | Mitchell Budde | Interesting. Anything in particular? Especially objects or reagents? |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:12:52 | Brad | Just a set of clothes. |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:13:07 | Mitchell Budde | Mkay. |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:44:18 | Mitchell Budde | Are rats and other vermin common in Sandpoint? |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:45:35 | Brad | Yep. Sometimes even a ROUS. |
| Jan 15, 2017 19:46:28 | Mitchell Budde | Their population takes a nosedive these next couple of nights. |
| Jan 15, 2017 20:03:07 | Brad | You have had a lot of dreams about murdering your mother, and even some about torturing goblins to death. |
| Jan 15, 2017 20:10:04 | Mitchell Budde | That's fair. I feed their eyes to Ori. |
| Jan 17, 2017 11:45:47 | Brad | So what are you doing to the rodents? Are you catching them and using them for things? If so, how are you catching them? |
| Jan 17, 2017 11:48:28 | Mitchell Budde | I'm sending Ori out at nights to catch them. Amara then uses them in necromatic experiments. I'm trying to justify why she's starting to take necromancy spells when in her back story she refused to study it. She's starting from scratch and using some of her mom's notes.  |
| Jan 17, 2017 11:49:58 | Brad | I assumed it was something like that. 
Thanks for doing so much with your character. It's a pleasure to DM for. |
| Jan 17, 2017 11:50:54 | Mitchell Budde | My pleasure! |
| Jan 20, 2017 14:56:16 | Brad | Are you busy tomorrow? I'm thinking we should do Persona Valentine's Day. I could come around 10 (or earlier) if you still start work at 14:00. |
| Jan 20, 2017 14:58:36 | Mitchell Budde | I'm scheduled to work from 11:30 to 8 but I will most likely be out more around 7:30. We could do it that night? If transportation would be an issue I could drop by your apartment. If that works? |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:01:47 | Brad | We can do it tomorrow night at my place, then. |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:09:07 | Mitchell Budde | Ok sweet. |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:12:31 | Brad | Bring your laptop, I'm curious about this simulator. |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:14:55 | Brad | You get first dibs to DM on Sunday. Want to? |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:30:08 | Mitchell Budde | Sure! |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:38:39 | Brad | Whose house? |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:40:23 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay and I are always happy to host. Though it may be somewhat messy.  |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:41:59 | Brad | I'm pretty sure all 3 places have been varying degrees of messy, so we'll deal. |
| Jan 20, 2017 15:42:41 | Mitchell Budde | Alright haha. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:04:19 | Mitchell Budde | Ok so I guess there's a wedding tonight. I don't think I'm going to be free before midnight. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:04:54 | Brad | Sure. 'nother time. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:05:27 | Mitchell Budde | Sorry. Usually I'd get more heads up then none at all. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:06:05 | Brad | Yeah, a wedding is not normally something that sneaks up on you. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:07:29 | Mitchell Budde | It doesn't help that my schedule is always listed as time-close. So I can't guess events based on what time I should leave. I leave when I'm done. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:09:16 | Brad | Oh right, the institute has a wedding! I totally thought you just had a wedding to go to that someone just told you about. |
| Jan 21, 2017 12:09:54 | Mitchell Budde | Oh haha no. I'm just cleaning for it. |
| Jan 22, 2017 10:16:54 | Mitchell Budde | With where things are at do you want to bring pesona 4 over today?  |
| Jan 22, 2017 10:17:19 | Brad | Was planning on it, just in case. |
| Jan 22, 2017 10:18:44 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. Lynnay might sleep in some from her overnight so it might honestly be more of a hang out for a couple of hours rather than dnd. |
| Jan 22, 2017 10:19:07 | Brad | Sure |
| Jan 22, 2017 11:54:40 | Brad | I'll probably be ten minutes late. |
| Jan 22, 2017 11:55:10 | Mitchell Budde | No worries. |
| Jan 22, 2017 12:37:58 | Brad | I always overestimate south minneapolis buses. It'll be a bit longer. |
| Jan 22, 2017 12:38:28 | Mitchell Budde | No worries! |
| Jan 22, 2017 12:38:54 | Mitchell Budde | I said with more enthusiasm. |
| Jan 22, 2017 13:00:34 | Brad | Here |
| Jan 29, 2017 12:27:44 | Brad | You still watching Gundam? |
| Jan 29, 2017 12:29:28 | Mitchell Budde | Not at the moment I stopped watching for a day or two and just never started back up. I should though. |
| Jan 29, 2017 12:29:50 | Brad | Have you watched any Gundam Wing? |
| Jan 29, 2017 12:29:50 | Brad | Have you watched any Gundam Wing? |
| Jan 29, 2017 12:31:05 | Mitchell Budde | Only bits and pieces. |
| Feb 5, 2017 08:52:45 | Mitchell Budde | So what is the plan for tonight? |
| Feb 12, 2017 09:40:22 | Brad | Would you be able to pick me up? That way I can hand off the computer. |
| Feb 12, 2017 09:42:58 | Mitchell Budde | Sure thing! |
| Feb 12, 2017 10:56:44 | Mitchell Budde | Leaving now. |
| Feb 12, 2017 11:20:37 | Mitchell Budde | Outside. |
| Feb 13, 2017 15:59:49 | Mitchell Budde | If you don't mind my asking how busy are you most Monday afternoons? |
| Feb 13, 2017 16:10:21 | Mitchell Budde | For context someone had to leave Neverwinter Nights and we're looking to fill the spot if you would be interested. |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:20:38 | Brad | Sounds good. You can facebook me any links I'll need. And I forgot to ask, but if Lynnay is free tomorrow I was going to drop by to go over computer stuff, so if it works out we could talk DnD |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:23:57 | Mitchell Budde | So much stuff to send. Depends what time. I have an interview at 8am.  |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:26:16 | Brad | Would noon work? |
| Feb 13, 2017 19:26:47 | Mitchell Budde | It should! |
| Feb 14, 2017 12:05:48 | Brad | Here |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:37:07 | Brad | What peples live around Neverwinter or farther north? |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:41:33 | Mitchell Budde | The city itself is one of the most cosmopolitan on the continent boast a rather diverse population demografic. To the north there are the Uthgard tribes (some of which have 'civilized' since unification) which are humans and half-orcs and to the south are largely human lands but a good amount of dwarves and respectable population of elves. Way north is the port town of Luskan which is made up of Illuskan (a human sub group) raiders and the arcane brotherhood which accepts any members (though it is an evil organization). |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:48:55 | Brad | Do the druids in Faerun have any sort of society, hierarchy, or politics? |
| Feb 14, 2017 15:51:19 | Mitchell Budde | Different circle have different rules. The druids in Neverwinter usually belong to the Circle of the Sword and there is a hierarchy of elders who make decisions that druids carry out with an Archdruid at the head. |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:09:39 | Brad | 13,13,13,15,15,16
Everything within 4 of eachother, and five of them were odd. |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:10:12 | Mitchell Budde | Haha very nice. You going druid? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:10:49 | Brad | Yep, Human circle of the moon (mechanically) |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:14:56 | Mitchell Budde | Unless you're a particularly social druid this probably hasn't been a huge deal but most people wouldn't differentiate between your magic and arcane so you know to be careful with who knows of your abilities. @ |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:16:18 | Brad | Ah, interesting. That changes some minor things. So clerics probably only avoid suspicion by being very obviously godly? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:17:29 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. Holy symbols and all. Some crafter caster masquerade using divine symbols as casting foci. This is incredibly dangerous as it is seen as heretical by all but gods of magic.  |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:18:03 | Mitchell Budde | Crafty casters* |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:21:27 | Brad | Would being very ostensibly devoted to a nature deity give me the best of both worlds? I'd seem like a cleric to the ignorant, but the informed wouldn't consider it blaspheming? |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:24:03 | Mitchell Budde | That would probably fly for everyone but people who hate that God (which shouldn't be a ton) Many will see you as an ignorant savage to an extent though (unless that doesn't quite mesh with what you want). |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:26:12 | Brad | I think I'd prefer it.  |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:27:26 | Mitchell Budde | Perfect. I was going to start you in Highcliffe so if there's any roll playing you need to do let me know or include it in your backstory. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:21:21 | Mitchell Budde | The druid circle plays a role in this plot so some things to consider (and if this doesn't work with what you had in mind we can work to make it fit): the Circle of swords has become very insular since the Spellplague and has broken off into two "factions". To the south is the Circle of the Mere which tends to lands of the Mere of Dead Men and to the north is the Circle of the Wood which keeps to the Neverwinter Woods. They say the spit was due to a schism between the two highest ranking druids after the death of the last Arch Druid during the Luskan War. Elder Vashne left with a small cadre of druids and went into exile in the swamp while Elder Naevan kept a more traditional touch within the Neverwinter wood. No new arch druid has been named. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:22:50 | Brad | The factions don't claim their own elder is Archdruid? |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:23:23 | Mitchell Budde | Kaiser, Volsung, Köhler, Hapsburg for names. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:24:35 | Mitchell Budde | As far as you can tell neither wants to take that step as it would mean the other circle was truly lost to them. Most members hope the Circle can be restored. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:28:37 | Mitchell Budde | As to their beliefs Vashne thinks the druids should allow the lands to change and they should change to mirror the lands. Naevan takes a traditional approach as trying to keep everything preserved as is.  |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:31:32 | Brad | What sort of change? Do they allow forests to be cut down for lumber and farmland, or do you mean the more godly, apocalyptic changes? |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:41:44 | Mitchell Budde | It's kept somewhat vague buy Vashne explains that he chose the Mere as his home because it's the perfect example of what he means. It used to be a small swamp region but there was a terrible battle between orcs dwarves and elves that took place there. Such was the carnage to the land that the swamp grew and gained it's new name. He wants druids to emulate that kind of change. Take that as you will. |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:45:15 | Brad | Compared to the present, when was the end of the spellplague and when was the Archdruid's death?  |
| Feb 16, 2017 15:49:48 | Mitchell Budde | I'm at ASI so I don't have my timeline but Spellplague ended roughly 16 years ago and the Archdruid died 19-20 years ago. |
| Feb 16, 2017 18:18:37 | Mitchell Budde | I was off by quite a bit. Archdruid died 30 years ago, and Spellplague ended 7 years ago. |
| Feb 16, 2017 19:00:28 | Brad | For people not directly related to the arcane, was the end of the spellplague important? Was life during the spellplague more dangerous or anything? |
| Feb 16, 2017 19:03:14 | Mitchell Budde | In some places there were devestating natural disasters and many kingdoms were thrown into chaos following the loss of magic networks but for the average Joe farmer not really. |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:18:02 | Mitchell Budde | One more thing about the druid though they have split they do meet once a year during a time sacred to Silvanus so you have a passing familiarity with the whole Circle of Swords.  You know for the past few years crops have been failing near the Mere though why is unknown. A possible hook for you is you may have run into the Mere druid Elanee who believes that a traveling group may be involved somehow in all this (she doesn't blame them though). |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:21:50 | Brad | Would that be a time when people mingle and can share ideas and philosophy, or is it mainly pomp and tradition and trying to poach others to your circle is frowned upon? |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:23:03 | Mitchell Budde | More of the former. There are important rituals that need to be performed to keep the forest of Neverwinter healthy as well |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:27:20 | Mitchell Budde | If you do take the Elanee route let me know because she would share some details with you. |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:32:07 | Brad | I definitely will take that route. I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with Vess having talked with druids from the Mere. I think things will work smoother if she isn't a part of the circle, but I need more info about their views before I can justify that. Might require roleplay.  |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:32:25 | Brad | Have you looked into free copies of tabletop simulator? |
| Feb 18, 2017 18:38:07 | Mitchell Budde | Sorry they were out. But If you want I will gift you a copy. Elanee recently made contact with the group but they turned down her offer of aid. She tells you that she was assigned the region of the Mere that West Harbor sits upon. She was too late to help but she saw the aftermath of a slaughter there and this group leaving the village with a powerful magical artifact of some sort. They've been consistently attacked by outsiders since leaving. She thinks this magic item is tied to the spreading blight from the mere. She's been worried that you're the first druid she's seen since the last yearly meeting and she's going to search for Elder Vashne or any other members of her circle |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:15:38 | Brad | Does she have a description of the group and the artifact? |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:44:54 | Mitchell Budde | The artifact had to be small because they kept it wrapped in a silk bundle. The one carrying the shard was a half-orc tall and thin for his kind. He wore a chain shirt or mithril and could be quite abrasive. There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort and used a bow. He seemed more naive and a bit meek. The final member was a dwarf female who wore no armor and used a specialized axe in combat. She bore many scars and took a strong disliking to Elanee though she knew not why. @ |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:53:28 | Brad | Elanee didn't know why, right?
And when you say she was assigned this portion of the mere, you mean that she was told to investigate that area? How long ago was she instructed to do that? |
| Feb 18, 2017 19:55:51 | Mitchell Budde | No she's been tending to the life in that area for many years. Since the schism. |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:04:04 | Brad | So Elashnee only took an interest in them after seeing them leave the village? Does she have any evidence that they aren't involved, or is she just going off of gut? Does she seem like the naive, trusting type? |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:14:23 | Mitchell Budde | Correct. Going off gut. Depends on how shallow your character is. Based on her looks she seems to be a very young elf, but she doesn't seem to have that air of naivete about her. Even if they aren't involved directly with the growing blight  the presence of outsiders is worry some. |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:19:49 | Brad | Do you have a plan for introducing me? |
| Feb 18, 2017 20:23:05 | Mitchell Budde | I can force it if need be easily enough but I'll try and make and set the scene so you're all in Highcliffe together. |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:46:41 | Brad | "There was a half elf bard who could perform magic of some sort"
As in bard magic? I just noticed this and don't know whether you accidentally gave me extra info.  |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:47:50 | Mitchell Budde | Bard is a general term in Faerun. It was more that he had access to magical power. |
| Feb 20, 2017 14:48:57 | Brad | Gotcha.  |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:00:16 | Mitchell Budde | Can I get your Skype info? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:00:43 | Brad | Brad.aylsworth@gmail.com |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:01:00 | Brad | I think |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:02:10 | Mitchell Budde | Contact request sent |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:04:54 | Mitchell Budde | Also my server is BuddeCorner and the password is Jakeisanerd  |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:25:19 | Mitchell Budde | You are listening in on this. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:29:29 | Mitchell Budde | What will you be doing now? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:29:44 | Brad | I'm following Balthazar and Dimirrodin. As a cat |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:31:38 | Mitchell Budde | Stealth check please. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:31:59 | Brad | Use the ingame one? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:32:16 | Mitchell Budde | Up to you. |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:35:27 | Mitchell Budde | You hear this |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:37:22 | Mitchell Budde | Any response |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:50:25 | Mitchell Budde | Start to follow again? |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:55:47 | Mitchell Budde | You are told that the roads are dangerous and that a ship would be the safest route barring the lizard folk. He just met a adherent of Neverwinter heading in that direction you could maybe travel with.@ |
| Feb 20, 2017 17:57:57 | Brad | I'm not confident about the safety of ship travel, so that Neverwinter person  sounds perfect. If he could get me into contact with them it'd be deeply appreciated. |
| Feb 20, 2017 18:00:35 | Mitchell Budde | He will send a runner. |
| Feb 20, 2017 18:09:37 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Feb 20, 2017 21:55:11 | Brad | I want to see if I can place the name "Kelgor". 13 Religion, 14 History |
| Feb 20, 2017 21:55:47 | Mitchell Budde | You cannot.  |
| Feb 21, 2017 15:10:31 | Brad | Did Elanee really only see the three of them, not four? |
| Feb 21, 2017 15:11:15 | Mitchell Budde | She saw a fourth when they left but he then left the group and there were only 3 when she met them
 |
| Feb 27, 2017 21:19:22 | Brad | Outside the city I'm going to dig up a cache of my belongings, and then send one Animal Messenger to Elanee and one to my family. |
| Feb 27, 2017 21:19:55 | Mitchell Budde | Ok. |
| Mar 6, 2017 17:29:39 | Brad | Sorry, one minute |
| Mar 6, 2017 17:37:06 | Brad | ...nevermind, missed that text |
| Mar 13, 2017 13:03:07 | Brad | Do you want fighter? The more I think about what Jake's session will be like, the less I care if my character will have an interesting personality. I'd happily switch. |
| Mar 13, 2017 13:03:48 | Mitchell Budde | Nah it's all good. I have warlock... plans now.  |
| Mar 14, 2017 11:52:46 | Brad | Mind if I drop by in about half an hour? |
| Mar 14, 2017 11:53:28 | Mitchell Budde | Not at all |
| Mar 14, 2017 12:34:37 | Brad | Here |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:07:15 | Mitchell Budde | If you wanted to play as diggity that would be fine. Or if they just want to do it with two players. Whatever works for you 3. |
| Apr 2, 2017 17:59:55 | Brad | Amara knows that those stained glass windows depicted many components related to necromancy |
| Apr 2, 2017 18:00:19 | Mitchell Budde | Oh good.  |
| Apr 2, 2017 18:56:06 | Brad | It seems like the creatures are being drawn into the box depicted on their windows, faces filled with fear. At first glance it had seemed they were being conjured out of it. |
| Apr 5, 2017 19:30:55 | Mitchell Budde | Any mornings coming up you'd be free for persona? |
| Apr 5, 2017 22:03:38 | Brad | Maybe Friday or Saturday. Some schoolwork came up, sadly. |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:01:36 | Brad | I forgot that Saturday is a weekend and the bus schedule gets weird. So if I don't hear from you, I'll just do the buses and I'll arrive around 8:40. Or, if you let me know, you can just come pick me up whenever.

Because you have a car and Persona 5 is more important than my own feelings of independence. |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:06:04 | Mitchell Budde | Let me shower and I will come get you.  |
| Apr 8, 2017 07:49:25 | Mitchell Budde | Outside |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:54:44 | Brad | Amara keeps a journal, yes?  |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:55:22 | Mitchell Budde | Yup. |
| Apr 9, 2017 20:59:59 | Brad | You recognize those notes as pages from your journal. You have no idea how or when he managed to get them, but when you check you indeed see some missing pages.

The rest of the trash was the other things you knew he took, and even some chicken bones you have a sneaking suspicion originated from your meals.  |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:03:45 | Mitchell Budde | Gross. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:06:22 | Brad | Does Tyall know Amara's old stance on necromancy? |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:12 | Brad | Also, does Aljaan know? I'm not sure how meaningful Josh's comment is. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:17 | Mitchell Budde | He knows she hates it and would never use it but not why. |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:08:50 | Mitchell Budde | Amara has said that she hates it in game, but never elaborated much. |
| Apr 10, 2017 08:08:34 | Mitchell Budde | Outside |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:03:43 | Brad | You up for Persona Saturday morning? |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:04:19 | Mitchell Budde | Heck yeah! |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:06:00 | Brad | I'll look into getting there around 8, but I need to make sure my bike is up to it. |
| Apr 20, 2017 18:08:48 | Mitchell Budde | Ok sweet! |
| Apr 22, 2017 07:41:29 | Brad | I'll be there around 8:40. |
| Apr 22, 2017 07:41:52 | Mitchell Budde | Ok! |
| Apr 22, 2017 08:47:02 | Brad | In the back |
| Apr 30, 2017 08:36:44 | Brad | So I sat down to flesh out Vess's Neverwinter ally a little, and instead spent several hours writing out an overview of the last four generations of Vess's family. |
| Apr 30, 2017 08:41:20 | Mitchell Budde | Classic Brad.  |
| Apr 30, 2017 17:37:58 | Brad | More dreams about murdering your mom. If this bothers you, you have so much trouble you can't sleep much and you take a point of exhaustion. |
| May 1, 2017 07:56:02 | Brad | ETA 8:30 |
| May 1, 2017 08:35:26 | Brad | Back door |
| May 1, 2017 15:42:15 | Mitchell Budde | Fuck insta death spells. |
| May 1, 2017 16:07:01 | Brad | Does this game have any sort of homunculus item? |
| May 1, 2017 16:07:37 | Brad | I may have to review my decision on golems. I found the Manual of Golems in the DMG  |
| May 1, 2017 16:25:24 | Mitchell Budde | That's fine.  |
| May 1, 2017 16:37:16 | Brad | Oh, I forgot to bring up that I'm wondering if I can alter the long rest rules to fit my character better. Something like she doesn't have to get consecutive hours of sleep for them to count, but she requires 10 hours for a long rest and sleep she gets somewhere weird only counts half time. She'd still prepare spells when everyone else would, because otherwise that would be chaos. |
| May 1, 2017 16:38:06 | Mitchell Budde | I'm ok with that. |
| May 8, 2017 20:30:55 | Mitchell Budde | Find Brother Dehlila she will find you a new room. |
| Jun 13, 2017 08:52:04 | Brad | Any chance you've got a spare flash drive we could use for Persona 5? |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:21:17 | Mitchell Budde | Absolutely. |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:32:35 | Brad | Are either of you going to be downtown/campus this afternoon? |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:36:10 | Mitchell Budde | Lynnay will be at the corner W from 4 to midnight.  |
| Jun 13, 2017 10:40:42 | Brad | Sweet. If you could get the files onto a flash drive, I'll stop by the corner W a little after 4. |
| Jun 13, 2017 11:14:51 | Mitchell Budde | Done. |
| Jul 3, 2017 13:30:48 | Brad | What company made your dice? |
| Jul 3, 2017 13:58:41 | Mitchell Budde | Easy Roller.  |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:37:28 | Brad | Do you just have Discord on your laptop? |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:37:45 | Mitchell Budde | Yeah. |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:38:28 | Brad | Do you have a one-shot character yet, or do you need any info from me for it? |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:39:28 | Mitchell Budde | Since Lynnay was doing a spoof character I was going to make a pink haired anime protagonist who is despretly trying to avoid her fate.  |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:46:02 | Brad | I can work with that? 
And I think if you two gender swap a third time, I'm just going to assume it's your kink. |
| Jul 6, 2017 14:47:20 | Mitchell Budde | Oh I'm sorry I'm not playing into your heteronormative worldview Braaaad.   |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:16:43 | Brad | Did anyone end up going above 20? |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:16:43 | Brad | Did anyone end up going above 20? |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:17:26 | Mitchell Budde | No. |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:14:04 | Brad | ? |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:14:50 | Mitchell Budde | Those are apparently your sunglasses that are now in my possesion.  |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:16:16 | Brad | I don't remember ever wearing those. But I'll take 'em. |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:18:57 | Mitchell Budde | He swears they are yours.  |
| Jul 15, 2017 13:21:12 | Brad | Jake? Ah, you know, those might be mine, then. I don't know why they don't look right, but if I saw them in person I probably would. Thanks |
| Aug 21, 2016 18:16:26 | Brad | Attachment: application/smil, Attachment: image/jpeg |
| Feb 15, 2017 23:50:19 | Brad | Attachment: image/jpeg, the size of a normal toblerone, because I swear you tried to convince me the one on your table is normal. |
| Feb 16, 2017 00:03:57 | Someone else | Attachment: image/jpeg, I don't know what you're talking about.  |
| Jul 7, 2017 21:12:38 | Someone else | Attachment: image/jpeg, Anime protagonist stats: accomplished  |
| Jul 15, 2017 12:44:34 | Someone else | Attachment: image/jpeg |

| Date | Sender | Message |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feb 19, 2017 14:58:39 | Someone else | Hey everyone this will be the new text chat for Neverwinter Nights with new addition Brad (he's pretty ok I guess). I was going to wait til after role playing but why doesn't everyone level up to 5 before tomorrow. That way we don't do it mid session. Lizardfolk and who knows what else awaits you in the next leg of your journey! |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:06:45 | Someone else | Welcome bradical. What you playin? |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:06:58 | Someone else | Dwarf monk, with missing teeth? |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:08:39 | Brad | Close. I have all my teeth, but they're on my forearm instead of in my mouth.
Horrible accident. Don't like to talk about it. |
| Feb 19, 2017 15:14:28 | Someone else | That's.. thats... devastating. |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:20:29 | Someone else | I start mason city next Thursday  |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:21:19 | Someone else | Alright. Thank you for the heads up! |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:35:52 | Someone else | I am free this Monday, but will busy future Mondays for a few weeks |
| Feb 22, 2017 10:36:09 | Someone else | Ok. |

| Feb 27, 2017 12:58:51 | Someone else | Der Ritter are the finest riders in the kingdom ;) |
| Mar 6, 2017 09:30:20 | Someone else | Hey guys feel free to make your characters before we play today. 4d6 reroll ones. I care little about backstory and what not since this is a few sessions maximum. Background on the world: its 97% covered in water, and storms are crazy. You'll be on land the entirety of the game so you....shouldn't drown? The world is pretty unexplored. The major kingdom is the klessa empire, a large island chain. And rumors of another kingdom far SE have been heard.  |
| Mar 6, 2017 14:55:40 | Someone else | Bit of bad news someone called in sick to ASI tonight so I will be going to work. Feel free to play without me! |
| Mar 6, 2017 15:16:06 | Someone else | Eh, I'll vote to just pass on playing if it's just us 3 let us know what's up for next week!  |
| Mar 12, 2017 12:32:06 | Someone else | Hey just wondering, is jake DM-img tomorrow? |

| Mar 12, 2017 15:11:52 | Someone else |  I haven't heard from brad on this matter is he down to play tomorrow? |
| Mar 12, 2017 15:12:30 | Brad | Yes I am. |

| Mar 13, 2017 12:09:59 | Someone else | I am a sorcerer but I was unaware they are usually the face of a party..and I'm not really a face :s |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:20:55 | Someone else | That's more than ok! |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:44:33 | Someone else | What will you be?? |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:44:58 | Someone else | She also picked the hermit background. So while she is charismatic she's still patsy |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:45:31 | Someone else | Just a regular traveler. |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:49:05 | Someone else | Budde is a frog barbarian. I decided to let him to it, cuz I think it's a cool idea. |
| Mar 13, 2017 12:53:44 | Someone else | Jk budde is a warlock and brad is a fighter  |
| Mar 13, 2017 14:34:56 | Brad | Perfect HP rolls and normal class equipment? |
| Mar 13, 2017 15:08:08 | Someone else | Don't roll for hp, take max, and  class equipment isgood. If you want like a specific weapon or something go for it.  |
| Mar 13, 2017 16:07:48 | Someone else | The server is Fredroom and the password is Mitchisatool  |
| Mar 13, 2017 17:18:46 | Someone else | Lemme know when you're ready  |
| Mar 13, 2017 17:19:11 | Someone else |  I am |
| Mar 13, 2017 17:32:44 | Brad | I think everyone's ready |
| Mar 17, 2017 09:53:35 | Someone else | You guys up for DnD Monday? My internet at the hotel is eh, but I'm sure we could make it work. I got the night off.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 10:06:31 | Someone else | Nevermind :( |
| Mar 17, 2017 11:57:58 | Someone else | Why never mind :( |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:30:41 | Someone else | They are short staffed on Mondays still :( |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:41:16 | Someone else | Lol |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:45:03 | Someone else | It just gives me more time to plot your party's demise mwhahaha.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:47:28 | Someone else | Is it really that difficult of thing to plot? The only one really difficult to kill will be patsy.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:47:50 | Someone else | And you can just hit her with like 15scorching rays  |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:48:56 | Someone else | I don't know Jake, will you let me get into combat before you crit 16 times on a suprise round? |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:49:10 | Someone else | Don't give him any ideas! I want to be queen on the land |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:49:17 | Someone else | Probably not... EMOJI KA |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:50:16 | Someone else | To bad I've trapped you all on a boat. The King in Yellow loves cameos ;) |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:50:49 | Someone else | Haha he will be using those dice that he rolled like 80 nat 20's on |
| Mar 17, 2017 12:51:22 | Someone else | Mother of... lethander  |
| Mar 17, 2017 14:19:47 | Someone else | It's true though, I can't bargain with the water to not drown me.. Unless I'm buds with Poseidon..   |
| Mar 17, 2017 15:51:09 | Someone else | And let's be honest Balthazar can't swim.  |
| Mar 17, 2017 16:08:45 | Someone else | Well* Yet* |
| Mar 20, 2017 09:22:31 | Someone else | So guys (minus pope) we'll be continuing our magical mystery island campaign today then? I forget if I had you level up but feel free to do so. We will be lvl 4 |
| Mar 20, 2017 14:23:39 | Someone else | Sorry group Lynnay and I are trying to get a bunch of stuff sorted before we leave for the week and this is the only day we both will be home before Wednesday to get it done. Diggity will have to sit tonight out. |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:05:42 | Brad | So we should just skip it? |
| Mar 20, 2017 15:07:10 | Someone else |  Yeah we'll just continue it another time, when/pope can't do it sometime. |
| Mar 24, 2017 11:27:46 | Someone else | Is this Monday a thing guys? I'll still be at my hotel but I have internet? |
| Mar 24, 2017 11:28:46 | Someone else | I think budde is out of town this week |
| Mar 24, 2017 12:38:22 | Someone else |  It's been a particularly dnd-less few weeks. :( |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:45:32 | Someone else | Well well well Adventures I hope you've enjoyed your (well deserved) rest but once again trouble stirs. You may have uncovered the Esoteric Order of Dagon's machinations in Innsmouth but Grand Warlock Wilhelm Ryan escaped and now his dread gaze has settled elsewhere. Only you stand against the Eldritch Horrors but to do so you may have to stare into the Abyss.... if you dare.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:00 | Someone else | What in the world? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:45 | Someone else | Whwut |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:47:47 | Someone else | Don't tell me you forgot how you saved the coast from the deep ones? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:48:41 | Someone else | Did Cthulhu take over farun  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:49:04 | Someone else | No, I just would rather hear a romance for once.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:49:59 | Someone else | Sorry that was my bad. We'll pick up deep in the forests of Sein. You've recovered the element of air stolen by the twisted spirit Kuro but still must reclaim fire and water to restore the forest from the darkness that has blanketed it.   |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:31 | Someone else | I am so confused |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:52 | Someone else | I'll Call aedren the last airbender. Hes got a knack for that stuff  |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:50:56 | Someone else | A romance?? Perhaps between alassi and kelgarh? |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:51:19 | Someone else | Liked “A romance?? Perhaps between alassi and kelgarh?” |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:53:48 | Someone else | Dang it I don't know how I keep screwing this up. You've recovered the lost gem of Phandelver and we're enjoying the hospitality of the Fire Giant Bar and Grill but unfortunately a new guild othiwves has taken notice. Be careful as you navigate the various factions vying for dominance within the ciry. |
| Mar 29, 2017 20:54:05 | Someone else | Guild of thieves * |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:00:25 | Someone else | Too many campaigns... raz'll jump into your room with a mysterious rod and remind which campaign we're playing  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:00:58 | Someone else | also I did it wrong too. Arden, not aedren  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:03:25 | Someone else | I'm working towards an enormous Convergence arc to wrap up all campaigns.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:07:16 | Someone else | Sounds fun.... if you need additional campaigns, we could have a chat. I can fill you in on some characters of patsy and pope you could incorporate  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:13:36 | Someone else | Haha maybe down the road. For now I was just having a good old fashioned goof with ya'll |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:15:26 | Someone else | Oh you got me.  |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:21:29 | Someone else | You didn't get me! I'm too smart!.......ahaha..haha..ha |
| Mar 29, 2017 21:25:31 | Someone else | Obviously I would never be able to trick you Patsy.  |
| Apr 3, 2017 06:28:45 | Someone else | So we are playing today right? |
| Apr 3, 2017 09:32:18 | Someone else | That's the plan! |
| Apr 3, 2017 09:50:53 | Someone else | Awesome! I look forward to it. |
| Apr 3, 2017 11:27:01 | Someone else | Starting at 5-5:15ish?  |
| Apr 3, 2017 11:27:36 | Someone else | 5:30 |
| Apr 3, 2017 11:29:37 | Someone else | Balthazar's ready to become a dread pirate |
| Apr 3, 2017 15:55:28 | Someone else | What level are we friends? 5? |
| Apr 3, 2017 15:55:53 | Someone else | Yessum  |
| Apr 3, 2017 15:57:52 | Someone else | Dope  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:34:36 | Someone else | I am actually good to start whenever. If people need the 530 time that's ok otherwise the adventure awaits.  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:35:02 | Someone else | We'll get it launching.  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:37:58 | Someone else | Discord? |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:38:50 | Someone else | I forgot to set that up. Skype ok? |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:39:14 | Someone else | Yessir  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:39:20 | Someone else | For peasants  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:39:46 | Brad | It really only takes a a short time to download. Setup isn't long. |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:40:16 | Someone else | Look we all know how much of a plenty I am. |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:40:23 | Someone else | Pleb*  |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:40:50 | Brad | Tabletop Sim also seems to support voice chat. |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:40:59 | Someone else | Is anyone not ready? |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:42:03 | Someone else | I'm not ready yet |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:42:34 | Someone else | EMOJI KA |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:43:24 | Someone else | I don't get it Jake |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:44:40 | Brad | Unless he's trying to say "butt dick", I don't get it either. Or "pussy dick", if he's old-fashioned. |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:45:30 | Someone else | What vulgarity. |
| Apr 3, 2017 16:48:49 | Someone else | It was peach eggplant sickos  |
| Apr 3, 2017 17:03:10 | Someone else | I'm setting up |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:02:25 | Brad | Did Aljaan mention the subject of the notes found on the table? |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:04:05 | Someone else | Wrong chat homie |

| Apr 9, 2017 21:07:21 | Someone else | I'm cool with melding campaigns? |
| Apr 9, 2017 21:08:17 | Brad | The Lost Coast is so clearly a ripoff of the Sword Coast
 I don't even think melding them would be too difficult. |

| Apr 28, 2017 22:33:21 | Someone else | Hello adventurers, and good evening. Sorry if this is a bit late but I just want to confirm that everyone is a go for Monday, and to let you know I'll be sending out the loot you collected from last week. There's a lot if open threads and all of Neverwinter is open to you so if I had one request is to really think about what you want to do. |
| Apr 29, 2017 15:29:59 | Someone else | I will be there  |
| Apr 29, 2017 16:59:46 | Someone else | Same |
| Apr 29, 2017 17:24:15 | Someone else | You find a bunch of treasure as well as two hidden documents in Caleb's armor |

Bag of gems
Spinel Ring 
2 short swords

2 leather armors
Armor of Concelment (+1, disadvantage against being searched) 
3 Letters (1x Contract, 2x hidden documents) |
| Apr 29, 2017 17:24:38 | Someone else | C,
Things are proceeding smoothly. The Zhents have finally taken the hint and backed off with a little encouragement from A. The Luskan and local gangs are also losing ground, or falling in with us. Payment with the Unweavers has gone through, expect them before noon. I’ll be on the roofs with my handpicked so if things get unruly I’ll be there to save your skin. Again. I’m most interested in what this group of mercenaries is after. If we can turn them from the guard, and their reputation isn’t too overly exaggerated, we have all the pieces we need make our move. Honestly, I don’t know why A won’t let us make the move now. The royal army is tied up at the Old Owl Well, the southern lords won’t lift a finger for Nasher, and the city guard are a joke. I think it’s time we take the initiative on the matter. If we get the results for what Benefactor is after A won’t be able to keep us out of the inner circle anymore. Think on it C.

| Apr 29, 2017 17:25:01 | Someone else | C,
Derrick has killed another citizen and two guards on his last shakedown, time to cut him loose. Permanently. I’ve made it clear we will not accomplish anything by drowning the docks in blood. I agree with your assessment on M, they are becoming far too aggressive and drawing too much attention to the situation. Nasher’s gaze may be on the south but the harbor is the last card he has to play and won’t give it up as easily as M presumes. We may have to move forward with Contingency as we discussed. Cut a deal with the mercs if you can, if they persist allow them to take you. Benefactor is watching the situation closely.

| May 1, 2017 14:41:28 | Someone else | I don't know if I would use the word "important" ;) |
| May 1, 2017 15:02:12 | Someone else | I just read this again. Shit, I didn't know we were that important. Also we don't reason with criminals. It's time "the Enforcers" took back the docks! |
| May 1, 2017 15:20:05 | Someone else | We are about to be. Or else it's their problem  |
| May 1, 2017 16:55:21 | Someone else | When do we start? |
| May 1, 2017 16:56:58 | Someone else | I'm could right now but otherwise 530. |
| May 1, 2017 17:00:56 | Someone else | I wrote down all loot, otherwise I'm getting on now  |

| May 1, 2017 22:00:28 | Someone else | Bello  |
| May 4, 2017 20:28:53 | Someone else | So as I'm planning the next session I thought I would just mention that if you thought your time traveling jaunt through the Astral plane was weird I think you have all broken the timeline irreparably. +100xp I guess? |
| May 4, 2017 20:31:25 | Someone else | Eh? |
| May 4, 2017 20:32:00 | Someone else | He means we're level 10 now  |
| May 4, 2017 20:33:35 | Someone else | I think you put it best Josh. You all just pulled the master sword without the spiritual stones my dudes. |
| May 4, 2017 20:46:28 | Someone else | Is that cuz we killed that guy? I shattered his shardy thing around his neck  |
| May 4, 2017 20:47:17 | Someone else | Hm. I-I don't know what to say. |
| May 4, 2017 20:55:26 | Someone else | There will just be a few little things that I like to call Consequences; ) |
| May 4, 2017 21:05:38 | Someone else | Sounds fun  |
| May 8, 2017 09:15:02 | Someone else | Dnd tonight  |
| May 8, 2017 09:56:46 | Someone else | Yush |
| May 8, 2017 16:07:48 | Someone else | I will be ready to start at 5 if everyone else can join then otherwise see you all at 530. |
| May 8, 2017 16:08:11 | Someone else | Am |
| May 8, 2017 16:08:12 | Someone else | We'll be on at 5  |
| May 8, 2017 16:08:28 | Someone else | Like we've been on since five |
| May 8, 2017 16:08:42 | Someone else | Waited g |
| May 8, 2017 16:08:55 | Someone else | Waiting*  |
| May 8, 2017 16:10:18 | Someone else | I hope you're all ready for a high octane rescue mission. |
| May 8, 2017 16:10:38 | Someone else | EMOJI KA |
| May 8, 2017 16:11:49 | Someone else | So it's flammable? :D my eta is 5:20 |
| May 8, 2017 16:12:56 | Someone else | So much fire ;) |
| May 8, 2017 16:15:00 | Someone else | I should beat pope |
| May 8, 2017 16:22:00 | Someone else | Beet  |
| May 8, 2017 16:35:53 | Someone else | No beat him, like you do in your dreams |
| May 8, 2017 16:36:14 | Someone else | Questioned “No beat him, like you do in your dreams” |
| May 8, 2017 16:47:11 | Brad | Is that a reference to something? I've seen you react that way twice now. |
| May 8, 2017 16:50:08 | Someone else | Sorry on my phone I can click something someone says and make a question mark, or exclamation point, or thumbs up etc. next to the message. For some reason not everyone sees it when that happens  |
| May 8, 2017 16:50:33 | Someone else | Attachment: image/png, So it appears like this  |
| May 9, 2017 21:17:29 | Someone else | Over the remainder of the day as you all complete your tasks you hear rumors that the gang of criminals you encountered have made their move in the harbor attacking the Harbor Authority building and killing all the council members within except the harbor master himself who barely survived.  Lieutenant Roe was was killed trying to defend them.  |
| May 15, 2017 12:42:22 | Someone else | Hey mates, making sure we're on for today. Also we should maybe turn our focus towards the docks, that shits crazy. |
| May 15, 2017 16:26:33 | Brad | Yep, still doing it tonight |
| May 15, 2017 16:55:32 | Someone else | Always |
| May 16, 2017 10:59:34 | Someone else | Amazing session everyone. I hope that combat didn't drag to long. Considering you tackled an encounter way earlier then I had intended in its hardest form you all perfored with aplomb. Enjoy level 7 everyone.  |
| May 16, 2017 11:00:33 | Someone else | -10,000 gp
-Magic Amulet
-Magic Ring
-Another jet of communication 
-4 wooden staves (scythes but the blades disappeared)
-3 chain shirts (Mithril)
-1 Chain Shirt +1 (Mithril)
-A pouch of enchanted sand
-5 (un)holy symbols (Each are made intricate spun iron in the shape of a black sun bearing down on an armed figure, whose shadow takes the form of shield)
-A diagram showing the same runes on the ground of the room you fought the wraith in. There are many notes in the margins by at least 3 different people arguing over the proper runes to use and in which sequence. 
-An unsigned note |
| May 16, 2017 11:00:56 | Someone else | Dathrinir,
Enclosed is blessing from our King. Use it and it will allow us to commune within the shadows from hence forth. Our designs near Fort Locke have been delayed but I have decided you will continue your blessed work freeing slaves to join us in our holy calling. We still have not ascertained what the Gith are doing in the region but their raids along the High Road have been a boon to our efforts. Between them and petty squabbles within the city our work has gone nearly without problems. Before the next year has been heralded in our King will have returned to his rightful throne! Be warned BG has relocated to CK. The fool thinks to use us for his own ambitions but he will soon join us in shadows in ways he will never comprehend. Walk in shadows friend. |
| May 16, 2017 12:36:17 | Someone else | Evasion unlocked fireball me all you want.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:36:42 | Someone else | Oh, I will |
| May 16, 2017 12:37:40 | Someone else | Please, everyone stop using fire. Alassi is getting very depressed! |
| May 16, 2017 12:38:14 | Someone else | We will invest in something to take care of this issue for you, our barbarian friend.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:38:36 | Someone else | I can make fire resist potions? |
| May 16, 2017 12:44:17 | Someone else | If we can confirm a magic cloak won't end your ál Rambo benefits you can have the cloak  |
| May 16, 2017 12:45:27 | Someone else | EMOJI KA I'm so glad patsy didn't just go path of the bear, it's stupid good, but not nearly as much fun.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:46:15 | Brad | RAW, magic robes are not considered armor. Robe of the archmagi specifically states a benefit if the user is not wearing any armor. But I think Budde rules differently. |
| May 16, 2017 12:47:13 | Brad | But if Jake can just pump out large batches of potions per day, it's probably more efficient to do that. |
| May 16, 2017 12:47:54 | Someone else | I rule robes are armor. Cloaks however are not. |
| May 16, 2017 12:48:32 | Someone else | I also can fail potion making. Which sucks. Yesterday I failed a batch of 5 healing potions. (100 gp)  |
| May 16, 2017 12:50:56 | Someone else | But yeah I could start procuring fire resist potions. I plan on spending my share of the loot (post tithe) on recipes, and components for more potions. I've been assured my skills will increase along with the power of these potions.  |
| May 16, 2017 12:57:39 | Brad | Usually failing five potions would mean losing several hundred gp and five days lost. |
| May 16, 2017 12:58:57 | Brad | So I'm just saying be happy with what you have |
| May 16, 2017 13:00:15 | Someone else | We decided that 3 hours for a simple potion is adequate. And I can make up to five in like a 'batch' so long as I make one roll for the whole batch. It could be considerably worse. But it still sucks.  |
| May 16, 2017 13:07:45 | Brad | If we focus on fire as a party, things could get nasty. Vess now has a spell that removes resistances to fire and fire does an extra 2d6 damage, against one target for a minute. Any one element, since Alessi has a thunder sword. |
| May 16, 2017 13:45:55 | Someone else |  Oooo I Iike this for bosses |
| May 16, 2017 16:33:57 | Someone else | That sounds smart. I can make fire breathing potions!  |
| May 22, 2017 16:55:52 | Someone else | 5:30? |
| May 22, 2017 16:56:45 | Someone else | I'm game whenever |
| May 22, 2017 17:13:47 | Someone else | I'm trying to get confirmation from Brad. He was moving this weekend. If he is not free I would rather wait a week because we would be missing both Michael and Brad.  |
| May 22, 2017 17:16:59 | Brad | I forgot about it, but I should be set up in time. |
| May 22, 2017 17:17:01 | Someone else | Message delivery failure; Account is delinquent; please contact Project Fi Support (1-844-TALK2FI). |
| May 22, 2017 17:20:23 | Someone else | Yeah, unless there is a side quest down one of those tunnels???? |
| May 22, 2017 17:23:53 | Someone else | Sadly no :( |
| May 22, 2017 17:24:09 | Someone else | Sadly no side quest or sadly no playing today cuz Brad are a poop  |
| May 22, 2017 17:24:51 | Someone else | You are the dm.. aren't you the one with the ability to spawn a hidden society of mouse people in the caves? |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:19 | Someone else | No side quest. I'll wait til 6 and if I don't hear back we'll have to take a break for the week.  |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:30 | Someone else | I agree, and you can turn us all into cats, and do a mini adventure of cat and mouse |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:50 | Someone else | ^^ |
| May 22, 2017 17:25:51 | Someone else | You try calling him yet? |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:14 | Someone else | Just saying, I would love to be a cat |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:16 | Someone else | Alsassi might not |
| May 22, 2017 17:26:38 | Someone else | More like al sassy  |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:09 | Someone else | Sorry guys |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:23 | Someone else | But the mouse thing seems legit |
| May 22, 2017 17:27:49 | Someone else | It's ok!  |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:37 | Someone else | Looks like Brad can play! |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:45 | Someone else | Dope!! |
| May 22, 2017 17:30:50 | Someone else | Coming on  |
| May 22, 2017 17:31:23 | Someone else | Let the shenanigans begin |
| May 22, 2017 17:31:31 | Someone else | I was starting to get sad  |

| May 29, 2017 09:16:51 | Someone else | Today a thingy thing? |
| May 29, 2017 09:27:39 | Someone else | Yes sir. |
| May 29, 2017 09:30:10 | Someone else | My roommate has been interested in my talks of our adventures. I was wondering if you guys would be comfortable with him sitting in on this session or a future one. He said he would want to keep his mic muted to be a pure observer. I want to get him hooked sometime soon. |
| May 29, 2017 09:31:35 | Someone else | I'd be fine with that if everyone else is. I couldn't facilitate another member in this party however. |
| May 29, 2017 09:32:38 | Someone else | He just wants to watch, not play. |
| May 29, 2017 10:01:53 | Someone else | Yeah I don't mind a fan. Patsy and I have today off, but Michael works a normal day I think. So normal time? |
| May 29, 2017 10:02:35 | Someone else | Sounds good. |
| May 29, 2017 17:22:57 | Someone else | What threat threat will our heroes not take seriously this week? Maybe they'll make boner jokes at a skeleton, I don't know. IT'S THE ADVENTURE ZONE.  |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:34 | Someone else | Are people ready, I've got about 63 more of those to unleash if you aren't? |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:52 | Someone else | Bring em on.  |
| May 29, 2017 17:28:57 | Someone else | Patsy and I will be on shortly  |
| May 29, 2017 17:29:57 | Someone else | I'll drink up all the potions on your shelf, so let me introduce myself. IT'S NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 2! |
| Jun 11, 2017 13:29:34 | Someone else | Well well well Adventurers I hope you've enjoyed your brief respite but orcs, and priests, and traps await you all tomorrow! I hope you've been checking your shadows (oh wait they've disappeared)! |
| Jun 11, 2017 13:31:53 | Someone else | Heck ya let's do some killing!  |
| Jun 19, 2017 12:57:22 | Someone else | It's that time of the week again bois! We're all in oye! |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:05:48 | Someone else | So many orcs so little time.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:07:39 | Someone else | So much fire, so little resistance  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:07:58 | Someone else | Budde please don't kill me |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:09:02 | Someone else | I would never kill you Patsy! Khelgar would never forgive me.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:12:26 | Someone else | Attachment: image/gif, Very accurate depiction of our party.  |
| Jun 19, 2017 14:12:51 | Someone else | EMOJI KA |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:41:16 | Someone else | So...

| Jun 26, 2017 13:41:53 | Someone else | Not tonight. The lovebirds are off on their honeymoon.  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:49:29 | Someone else | Jake wanted me to ask if we planned to next week? |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:52:03 | Someone else | I would like to, but it depends on how Pope's feeling considering it will be ~2am in Germany.  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:52:47 | Someone else | 5+7 = 12 .. I'm down if I can get a set up  |
| Jun 26, 2017 13:53:23 | Someone else | Ok! |

| Jun 26, 2017 13:53:50 | Someone else | Got it. |
| Jul 5, 2017 18:02:40 | Someone else | We playing this Monday? |
| Jul 5, 2017 18:03:02 | Someone else | That's the plan!  |
| Jul 5, 2017 18:36:35 | Someone else | Dope dude!  |
| Jul 10, 2017 09:22:33 | Someone else | So we got ahold of the pope-I-nator? |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:40:51 | Someone else | Not yet. I'll message him online. Having given it thought though we are in the middle of a dungeon crawl so him miss one session would not throw anything off so If everyone else is good I think we'll move ahead tonight regardless. |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:48:56 | Someone else | Let's do it up! |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:49:48 | Someone else | There are orcs to slaughter and miners to traumatize!  |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:55:28 | Brad | I'm always up for traumatizing minors! |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:56:16 | Someone else | Budum-tish |
| Jul 10, 2017 11:59:20 | Someone else | A Hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:00:02 | Someone else | We are making Heros |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:25:11 | Someone else | Liked “I'm always up for traumatizing minors!” |
| Jul 10, 2017 12:26:09 | Someone else | Lol. I'm down to continue if pope can't. I'd like him to be there. But if it's just dungeoning, it's not imperative.  |
| Jul 10, 2017 13:33:15 | Someone else | Pope's not sure on his Internet holding out but he's trying to install tabletop now. He said he's ok with the party moving forward but if his eye tries to make him do anything evil he wants the party to kill him. |
| Jul 10, 2017 13:41:30 | Someone else | Perfect practice for our minor friend  |
| Jul 10, 2017 15:36:35 | Someone else | Lol |
| Jul 10, 2017 17:21:58 | Someone else | Michael is running a bit late. Maybe 10 mins? |
| Jul 10, 2017 17:23:16 | Brad | Perfect! |
