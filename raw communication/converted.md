To the south is the Circle of the Mere which tends to lands of the Mere of Dead Men and to the north is the Circle of the Wood which keeps to the Neverwinter Woods. They say the spit was due to a schism between the two highest ranking druids after the death of the last Arch Druid during the Luskan War. Elder Vashne left with a small cadre of druids and went into exile in the swamp while Elder Naevan kept a more traditional touch within the Neverwinter wood. No new arch druid has been named.</p></td>

I’ll be on the roofs with my handpicked so if things get unruly I’ll be there to save your skin. Again. I’m most interested in what this group of mercenaries is after. If we can turn them from the guard, and their reputation isn’t too overly exaggerated, we have all the pieces we need make our move. Honestly, I don’t know why A won’t let us make the move now. The royal army is tied up at the Old Owl Well, the southern lords won’t lift a finger for Nasher, and the city guard are a joke. I think it’s time we take the initiative on the matter. If we get the results for what Benefactor is after A won’t be able to keep us out of the inner circle anymore. Think on it C. </p><p>M</p></td>

I agree with your assessment on M, they are becoming far too aggressive and drawing too much attention to the situation. Nasher’s gaze may be on the south but the harbor is the last card he has to play and won’t give it up as easily as M presumes. We may have to move forward with Contingency as we discussed. Cut a deal with the mercs if you can, if they persist allow them to take you. Benefactor is watching the situation closely.     </p><p>A</p></td>
