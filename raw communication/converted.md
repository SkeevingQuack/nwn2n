Way north is the port town of Luskan which is made up of Illuskan (a human sub group) raiders and the arcane brotherhood which accepts any members (though it is an evil organization).</p></td>

To the south is the Circle of the Mere which tends to lands of the Mere of Dead Men and to the north is the Circle of the Wood which keeps to the Neverwinter Woods. They say the spit was due to a schism between the two highest ranking druids after the death of the last Arch Druid during the Luskan War. Elder Vashne left with a small cadre of druids and went into exile in the swamp while Elder Naevan kept a more traditional touch within the Neverwinter wood. No new arch druid has been named.</p></td>

They've been consistently attacked by outsiders since leaving. She thinks this magic item is tied to the spreading blight from the mere.

If we can turn them from the guard, and their reputation isn’t too overly exaggerated, we have all the pieces we need make our move. Honestly, I don’t know why A won’t let us make the move now. The royal army is tied up at the Old Owl Well, the southern lords won’t lift a finger for Nasher, and the city guard are a joke. I think it’s time we take the initiative on the matter.

Nasher’s gaze may be on the south but the harbor is the last card he has to play and won’t give it up as easily as M presumes. We may have to move forward with Contingency as we discussed.
